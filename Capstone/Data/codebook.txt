Category: 7.1 Electoral Rights Categories

Code: E-2: Procedural - Voter registration

Definition: Actors interested in delegitimizing the elections or
manipulating voter registration employ disinformation
regarding the right to vote
of certain groups to disturb the electoral process
and prevent (certain) voters
from voting.

Example: “Translation by the authors: if I now order postal
voting documents for a compatriot, check the post of-
fice, fill in the ballot paper
and hand it in, how do you
recognize the fraud? They
must be able to explain if
it’s so safe and easy, right?”
Targeted groups may include people with disabil-
ities. People, who have
been given a supervisor appointed by the court, for
example because they are
mentally or mentally impaired or in a coma, were
not allowed to vote in Germany until 2019. To cast a
vote, the person has to express a clear will, thus a per-
son unconscious in a coma
for the entire voting period
will probably not be able to
vote - even if they theoretically have the right to do
so.

Code: E-3: Procedural - Voter identification

Definition: Actors interested in delegitimizing the elections
or manipulating voter participation employ false information on required documents
for voter registration to disturb the electoral process,
confuse voters and and prevent (certain) voters from
voting.

Example: Claims of apparent lax enforcement of voter identification at the polling station.

Code: E-4: Procedural - Election campaign

Definition: Actors interested in delegitimizing the elections
or manipulating voter participation employ false information on
organizational restrictions on election campaign events under pandemic conditions to disturb
the electoral process, confuse voters and prevent (certain) voters from voting.

Example: Claims that rallies are illegal or that only a certain number of people are
allowed to attend. Possible disinformation regarding the violation of the principle of equal opportunities
and the state’s duty of neutrality in elections.

Code: E-5: Procedural - Election campaign and party funding

Definition: Disinformation on financing
of candidates and political
parties.

Example: Claims that a candidate is
financed by George Soros or
Bill Gates, for example.

Code: E-6: Procedural - Polling station

Definition: Actors interested in delegitimizing the
elections or manipulating voter participation might spread disinformation regarding opening
hours, location of polling
stations and polling site
changes etc. to disturb
the electoral process, confuse voters and to prevent
(certain) voters from voting.

Example: Claims that polling stations
close early, changed to a
new place to allow social
distancing etc.

Code: E-7: Procedural - Voting

Definition: Actors interested in delegitimizing the elections or manipulating voter participation spread disinformation
pertaining to procedures of
the postal vote to disturb
the electoral process, confuse voters and to prevent
(certain) voters from voting.

Example: False instructions on how
to apply for mail-in ballots,
how to fill out the ballot,
how and when to post it etc.

Code: E-8: Procedural - Vote count

Definition: Actors interested in delegitimizing the elections spreadisinformation on procedures of the vote count to
disturb the electoral process, confuse voters and
to prevent (certain) voters
from voting.

Example: Translation by the authors
“What is the point of elections if the greens count the
ballot papers?”
However, it is not permissible for only representatives
of one party or one ideology
to evaluate ballot papers.

Code: C-1: Candidates - Right to stand for elections

Definition: Actors interested in restricting
electoral competition to ensure
electoral victory (of the government)
might employ false claims that
eligibility conditions are not given in
order to exclude certain candidates.

Example: Fabricated criminal allegations.

Code: C-2: Candidates - Electoral registration of candidates and parties

Definition: Actors interested in restricting
electoral competition to ensure
electoral victory (of the government)
might make erroneous claims that
registration requirements are not
fulfilled to exclude certain candidates
and parties.

Example: Disinformation on changed
conditions for the collection of
signatures due to the pandemic.

Code: C-3: Candidates -
Electoral campaign

Definition: Actors interested in
harming/promoting certain candidates
or parties or increasing social and
political divisions in society spread
malinformation on the private lives of
candidates, or disinformation on
political intentions, connections and
activities of candidates and parties, or
false allegations of violating campaign
rules in order to defame candidates and
parties, manipulate public opinion or
influence voting behavior.

Example: Translation by the authors:
“Martin Sichert: Billionaire
George Soros is known to want
to make the world "better" in
his favor by imposing an Eco-
dictatorship on the people under
his control. every year at the
world economic forum in
Davos...” […] “Bearbock
(German politician) undergoes
5-year training program at the
world economic forum. There,
influential people are brought in
to implement a worldwide
political and social "change" in
the sense of Soros and co.
Translation by the authors:
"Attila Hildmann: Bearbock
verurteilte angriffe der hamas
auf israel: 'Wir stehen an der
Seite der Israelis' […] Bearbock
stands on the side of Israel
because Bearbock is Jewish"

Code: C-4: Candidates -
Election polls

Definition: Actors interested in (de-)legitimizing
the elections or harming/promoting
certain candidates or parties publish
fictitious, false or supportive election
polls to (de-) mobilize voters and/or
influence both voter turnout and
voters’ decisions.

Example: Circulation of non-
representative or fabricated
election polls, or the intentional
misinterpretation of
representative polls

Code: I-1: Integrity - Voter
registration

Definition: Actors interested in delegitimizing the
elections or actors unwilling to accept
electoral results might make
undocumented claims that for example
“dead voters” are voting to create
distrust in the electoral process and to
questioning electoral results.

Example: Translation by the authors: “If
the federal election takes place
by postal vote and many dead
people can vote for him, as was
the case with Biden, Scholz will
certainly become the next
chancellor.”
This disinformation is inspired
by similar claims made in the
USA during the 2020 election,
even though the probability of
dead people voting is
comparatively low in Germany
due to the link between the
voter registry and the local
resident registry, which does
not exist in the USA.

Code: I-2: Integrity - Voting

Definition: Actors interested in delegitimizing the
election or influencing voting behavior
might spread rumors of non-secrecy of
voting, sanctions on (non-)voters,
electoral violence, as well as last-
minute disinformation on election day
(e.g. drop-out of candidates), or rumors
that voting system is not safe and can
be manipulated to create distrust and
an atmosphere of fear, influencing
voting behaviour.
After the election, electoral contenders,
particularly defeated candidates, and
their supporters can make
undocumented claims on systematic
vote buying, ballot-box stuffing etc. to
create distrust, justifying electoral
defeat, and questioning electoral
results, as well as delegitimizing
elections in general and encouraging
electoral protests.

Example: Claims that mail-in votes are
inherently fraudulent.

Code: I-3: Integrity - Counting
and notification

Definition: Election losers and their supporters
make undocumented claims on lost
ballot boxes, and non-counted votes, or
the manipulation of vote counts and
election protocols etc. to justify
electoral defeat, question electoral
results and delegitimizing elections,
encouraging electoral protests.

Example: Under the hashtag
\#Wahlbetrug, it was alleged
that election workers had
devalued AfD votes, i.e. made
them invalid. The former AfD
parliamentary group leader of
the state parliament of Saxony-
Anhalt and now ex-AfD
politician André Poggenburg
published a corresponding
tweet. To underline his claim,
he shared the photo of another
tweet in which a user pretends
to be an election worker in
Saxony-Anhalt and attaches a
photo on which election
workers can be seen counting
votes.
The photo was not taken during
the vote count for the state
election in Saxony-Anhalt, but
comes from Washoe County,
Nevada, taken during the US
election in November 2020, as
the dts news agency, from
which the photo was taken,
confirmed to \#Faktenfuchs.
This is evident in the
community’s logo on the white
column. The logo is painted
over in red in the tweet, as are
the faces of the election
workers.
Translation by the authors:
“Almost 18,000 invalid ballot
papers!!!???? I've been a poll
worker several times. A
maximum of 5 invalid votes per
district. That stinks to high
heaven! \#Voting fraud”

Code: I-4: Integrity -
Publishing of electoral
results

Definition: Election losers and their supporters
make undocumented claims that late
publication or changes of results as
reported on election night indicate
electoral fraud to justify electoral
defeat, delegitimize democratic
elections and encourage electoral
protests.

Example: On election night, Trump
appeared to have a strong
“lead” in Pennsylvania, and he
expressed confidence he would
win the state. He even wrongly
“claimed” Pennsylvania’s
Electoral College votes in a
tweet before the race had been
decided. But in the days ahead,
as more mail ballots were
processed and counted, Joe
Biden pulled ahead and
ultimately won the state by
81,000 votes, or about 1%.
The slow counting of mail
ballots, and the way it eroded
Trump’s early advantage, was
the direct and expected result of
Pennsylvania’s election rules —
not fraud.
The counting process took
longer than in other states
because elections officials were
prohibited from starting their
work before Election Day.

Code: I-5: Integrity - Electoral
results

Definition: Election losers and their supporters
make undocumented claims on
electoral fraud to justify electoral
defeat, delegitimize democratic
election and encourage electoral
protests.

Example: Translation by the authors:
“letter election has risen from
14 to 30 percent and the \#CDU
has simultaneously risen to
almost 37 percent.
Coincidences do happen...
Anyone who believes that still
believes in Father Christmas.
The establishment will stop at
nothing, not even electoral
fraud. \#electionfraud
\#Itwsa21”

Code: I-6: Integrity - Electoral
observation

Definition: Government and its
national/international supporters;
government-friendly media promote
false claims by pro-government
election observers to legitimize non-
democratic elections.
Partisan election observers and media;
foreign governments make false claims
by partisan election observers (e.g.
exaggerating the importance of minor
irregularities) to delegitimizing
democratic elections.

Example: Unsubstantiated claims of a
lack of independent oversight of
the voting process and the vote
count.

Category: 7.2 Regulation of political content

Code: Ro-1 Gender-based violence
(Rec 81 DSA, (Art 34(1)(d)
DSA), Art. 3-9 Directive
combating violence against
women and domestic
violence44)

Definition: Rec 81 DSA, (Art 34(1)(d)
DSA), Art. 3 Directive
combating violence against
women and domestic violence,
Female genital mutilation, Art.
4 Forced marriage, Art. 5 Non-
consensual sharing of intimate
or manipulated material, Art 6
Cyber stalking, Art 7 Cyber
harassment, Art 8 Cyber
incitement to violence or hatred,
Art 9 Inciting, aiding and
abetting and attempt
Rec. 83 “A fourth category of
risks stems from similar
concerns relating to the design,
functioning or use, including
through manipulation, of very
large online platforms and of
very large online search engines
with an actual or foreseeable
negative effect on the protection
of public health, minors and
serious negative consequences
to a person's physical and
mental well-being, or on
gender-based violence. Such
risks may also stem from
coordinated disinformation
campaigns related to public
health, or from online interface
design that may stimulate
behavioural addictions of
recipients of the service.”
Art 2 (a) and (b), Directive
(2024/1385): “(a)
“‘violence against women’
means all acts of gender-based
violence directed against a
woman or a girl because she is a
woman or a girl or that affect
women or girls
disproportionately, that result in
or are likely to result in
physical, sexual, psychological
or economic harm or suffering,
including threats of such acts,
coercion or arbitrary
deprivation of liberty, whether
occurring in public or in private
life; […]
‘domestic violence’ means all
acts of physical, sexual,
psychological or economic
violence that occur within the
family or domestic unit,
irrespective of biological or
legal family ties, or between
former or current spouses or
partners, whether or not the
offender shares or has shared a
residence with the victim;”

Example: For example the case when the
intentional act of distributing,
publishing, or otherwise making
accessible intimate images,
videos, or audio recordings of
an individual without their
explicit consent is performed.
This includes material
originally obtained with consent
but shared beyond its agreed
purpose, as well as content that
has been digitally altered or
manipulated to degrade,
humiliate, or harm the
individual, e.g. like in revenge
pron.

Code: Ro-7: Labelling of Synthetic
Media (DSA Art. 39, G-E–DSA
Sec. 3.2.3)

Definition: Platforms must label synthetic
media (e.g., deepfakes, AI-
generated misinformation) in
political ads to prevent
misinformation during
elections.

Example: AI-generated videos of
candidates without clear
labeling as synthetic.

Code: Ro-9: Monitoring and Fact-
checking (G-E–DSA Sec. 3.3)

Definition: Platforms must label content
identified by fact-checkers as
disinformation, helping users
make informed decisions.

Example: Content spreading
misinformation without a fact-
check label.

Code: Ro-10: Racism

Definition:
ideas of racial uniqueness, racist attitudes towards specific social categories,
racist stereotypes, hate-speech, nationalism and common destiny, racial supremacy,
superiority and separation, conceptions of racial otherness, and anti-establishment world-view.

Category: 7.3 Disinformation Content

Code: D-1 Fabricated

Definition: Stories that completely lack any
factual base, are 100% false. The
intention is to deceive and cause
harm. One of the most severe types
of fabrication adopts the style of
news articles so the recipients
believe it is legitimate. Could be
text but also in visual format.

Example: Examples include the news
articles that are completely
invented, often used to
delegitimize a political
candidate during an election.

Code: D-2 Imposter

Definition: Genuine sources that are
impersonated with false, made-up
sources to support a false narrative.
It is actually very misleading since
source or author is considered a
great criterion of verifying
credibility (use of journalists name/
logo /branding of mimic URLs).

Example: Examples include Facebook
sites set up with very similar
looking logos and names of
very known media, such as the
Guardian or the BILD.

Code: D-3 Conspiracy theories

Definition: Stories without factual base as there
is no established baseline for truth.
They usually explain important
events as secret plots by the
government or powerful
individuals. Conspiracies are, by
definition, difficult to verify as true
or false, and they are typically
originated by people who believe
them to be true. Evidence that
refutes the conspiracy is regarded
as further proof of the conspiracy.
Some conspiracy theories may have
damaging ripple-effects.

Example: Examples for conspiracies
include the alleged planning
and orchestrating of the 9/11
attacks by the US government,
or the belief that politicians and
other powerful people are
reptilians and/or aliens.

Code: D-4 Hoaxes

Definition: Relatively complex and large-scale
fabrications which may include
deceptions that go beyond the scope
of fun or scam and cause material
loss or harm to the victim. They
contain facts that are either false or
inaccurate and are presented as
legitimate facts. This category is
also known in the research
community either as half-truth or
factoid stories able to convince
readers of the validity of a
paranoia-fueled story.

Example: Famous hoaxes often include
the distribution of a rumour that
a celebrity or person of public
interest has died.

Code: D-6 Rumours

Definition: Refers to stories whose truthfulness
is ambiguous or never confirmed
(gossip, innuendo, unverified
claims). This kind of false
information is widely propagated
on online social networks.

Example: Rumours can include a wide
variety of information, for
instance, that Facebook will
start charging their users or that
a Nigerian Astronaut is lost in
space and needs money to
return to earth.

Code: D-7 Clickbait

Definition: Sources that provide generally
credible or dubious factual content
but deliberately use exaggerated,
misleading, and unverified
headlines and thumbnails to lure
readers to open the intended Web
page. The goal is to increase their
traffic for profit, popularity, or
sensationalization. Once the reader
is there, the content rarely satisfies
their interest.

Example: These types of articles often
include mundane content such
as “do not eat this if you want
to loose weight” or “the world
was shocked to learn about the
truth of…”.

Code: D-8 Misleading connection

Definition: Misleading use of information to
frame an issue or individual. When
headlines, visuals, or captions do
not support the content. Separate
parts of source information may be
factual but are presented using
wrong connection
(context/content).

Example: These are often related to
decontextualisation. A famous
example was a photo by prince
William talking to
photographers, the photo and
text made it seem as if he was
using an offensive hand gesture,
however, from a different angle,
the situation was proven to be
completely innocent.

Code: D-9 Trolling

Definition: The act of deliberately posting
offensive or inflammatory content
to an online community with the
intent of provoking readers or
disrupting conversation. Today, the
term “troll” is most often used to
refer to any person harassing or
insulting others online.

Example: Trolling can often be done by a
group of people using
distinctive symbolism to
identify as trolls (such as Pepé
the Frog).

Code: D-10 Pseudoscience

Definition: Information that misrepresents real
scientific studies with dubious or
false claims. Often contradicts
experts. Promotes metaphysics,
naturalistic fallacies, and others.
The actors hijack scientific
legitimacy for profit or fame.

Example: Famous examples are the
claims that vaccines cause
autism or “proofs” that the earth
is actually flat.

Code: N

Definition:
None of the other codes can be applied or are relevant.
