0,"As expected, the 3 against one debate was a complete sham. The so called journalists or “moderators” were disgustingly partisan, hostile & unprofessional! They falsely fact checked Trump while they left Kamala lie many times without saying anything. There is no doubt in my mind that she was provided the questions beforehand !
No matter what, If a 90 minute biased debate is what it takes for you to be persuaded for which candidate to vote for, you’re not worthy of being able to vote.
If Taylor Swift endorsing Kamala is what makes up your mind, you’re idiotic !
Judge by 4 years of Trump’s successful presidency & the state of the country & the world versus almost 4 years of a world upside down & in chaos with Kamala by Joe’s side.
Judge by closed borders versus open borders, judge by almost no inflation or crime, versus high inflation & crime.
Judge by low taxes versus high taxes, less regulations versus burdensome regulations.
Judge by no war in Ukraine or in Israel versus Russia invading Ukraine & killing millions & Hamas committing heinous terrorist crimes against Israel & the Jewish people.
Judge by order on campuses versus hate & antisemitism & burning & rioting in those universities
Judge by one who governs by convictions , faith & patriotism versus one who changes positions everyday & says & does whatever the people want to hear.
Judge by steady leadership & consistency versus flip flops.
Judge by being respected abroad by friends & foes versus being ridiculed & laughed at by the whole world.
The qualities of both candidates are as clear as day & unless you want a corrupt government & democrat party & candidate to ruin the country further & keep weaponizing the DOJ & other government institutions against Americans, vote Trump !
Despite all his shortcomings he is a much better President for these tumultuous times !","[10, 27]"
1,"CHECKS AND BALANCES ARE DEAD IF TRUMP GETS BACK IN
The confluence of events yesterday – judge Cannon’s dismissal, on fabricated grounds, of the case against Trump for taking, hiding and refusing to return classified documents, and Trump’s naming of JD Vance as his VP candidate –further clarified Republicans’ will to transform our entire system of government into nothing but an instrument of (their) power.

“Conservative” judges and politicians are now operating almost without even the pretext of impartiality or duty to the constitution. Judge Cannon’s approach in the case, which has been fleshed out in recent years by “conservative” jurists throughout the legal system, was really to instrumentalize the law – lawfare, to use a term that “conservatives” have neutralized as an accurate description of *their* behavior by projecting it falsely onto others – by looking for or inventing loopholes or technicalities that allow the law to be applied in whatever direction is deemed suitable in a given situation.

While judges have obviously always had personal viewpoints and inclinations, the imperative to at least appear impartial is more than just a formal standard that people are supposed to hold themselves to. It is what makes the discipline *rigorous*. Even if your intention is to create new legal interpretations out of whole cloth, the need to position the argument within the developed framework of accepted law is *difficult*. You’re not supposed to be able to get away with overturning established law and practices based on shabby, self-serving, contradictory arguments that would be laughed out of court if you didn’t hold an impenetrable majority and which rot the legal system from the inside out by leaving behind an ever-expanding web of contradictions as each motivated ruling unspools a tangle of equally motivated clarifications and offshoots. It produces arbitrary nonsense and leaves us bereft of the protections of law.

“Conservative” jurists, including now even majorities on the supreme court, have emphatically crossed that threshold. And judges operating far down the chain, like judge Cannon, are now just serving up cases for the supreme court to adjudicate based on pretty much whatever they have the personal wherewithal to slap down on a piece of paper. Who can stop them? Even with a chief justice who would occasionally vote with the minority to preserve some semblance that they are practicing law instead of politics, with an illegitimately installed 6-3 supermajority his vote is not even required to manhandle the established laws and practices of the court and the country.

It is not properly Cannon’s job to do what she did, overturning decades of established practice on specious grounds, although her scope to abuse her authority was big enough.

But she has, at least, helpfully boiled it all down to how it works now: Conservative jurists – scholars, lawyers and judges – pore through the law to figure out how to construct the desired political outcomes, knowing that the final arbiter, the illegitimately installed 6-3 supermajority on the SC, will deliver the political outcome of a society dominated by a minority poured in concrete.

This would not be possible, or so effective, if checks and balances were in place and functioning. But since Republicans are fully in cahoots on these practices and do not check each other at all despite their constitutional duties, the only checks and balances that still exist are through voting for Democrats.

Finally, the elevation of JD Vance as Trump’s VP, would install a person who is a fervent 2020 election-denier in a position to block the handover of power in 2028 and who has presented elaborate defenses of why Trump’s efforts to prevent the transfer of power were legitimate uses of presidential power. This guy can construct – and generally already has constructed – sophisticated rationalizations for absolutely anything. And he has gone from being a self-described never-Trumper who called Trump unworthy of the office (and far worse) to the most obsequious of Trumpian boot-lickers, so there is no line he won’t cross and whose crossing he will not ably defend.

The collection of lickspittles and opportunists who now surround Trump act, like Trump himself, in a probing manner, forcing issues to find gaps and learn how they can break through defenses. This is the *nature* of their conduct. They are looking for devious ways to use power for their own purposes. It goes without saying that this tactic of probing the defenses, and the willingness to march through any breach, ultimately destroys the defenses.

But those defenses are the laws that define and protect our rights and protections against violation and exploitation. They are the backbone of our system.

Trump and his toadies like to think they are just playing hardball and that everyone else is as thoroughly rotten as they are, but they are WRONG. They are in fact destroying the system itself. If they no longer are willing to *restrain* themselves and act in the *spirit* of the system rather than probing for loopholes in the *letter* of the law, the system can only hold if they are PREVENTED FROM BEING IN A POSITION TO BREAK IT.","[21, 24]"
2,"TRUMP-VOTERS: DON’T FOOL YOURSELVES ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF RE-ELECTING HIM. THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT RUNS OUT WHEN A CHOICE IS CONFIRMED
That goes for personal relationships and it goes for the way the US is seen by people around the world. You Trump-voters have been on a 10-year journey to reconcile yourselves with violating your own standards for personal gain. And you have a lot of fellow travelers on the same train to make you feel validated in your choice. It’s easy for many of you to ignore or dismiss how your journey is viewed by the people who aren’t on it with you. But the rest of us have not spent 10 years trying to rationalize Trump. We’ve been looking on with the same disgust we felt for him all along, and for the spectacle of watching you talk yourselves into a Faustian bargain by demonizing all the rest of us.

Trump’s loss in 2020 meant that all of us could let bygones be bygones for the sake of getting along with loved ones and other people in our lives. But then you let the scumbag back in. And if you vote for him again after all the shit he did in office, after trying to overturn the 2020 election and after all the repulsive shit he’s said and done since then, the message received by everyone outside of your self-deluding bubble is going to be a thousand times worse than it was in 2016 or even 2020. It will be a confirmation.

This is not a threat – it’s the weary foresight of knowing how it feels to see people make an “eff-you” choice in full knowledge of the consequences for others. Like watching a loved one return to a relationship-harming habit, listening to their rationalizations for indulging themselves again … It’s one thing to make a mistake. It’s quite another to ratify it again later.

That’s a personal angle, but the same thing goes for the view of the US around the world. People across the world shook their heads in 2016 and looked on with dismay and disbelief as Trump destabilized every institution of world affairs and raised doubts about US commitments in a way that no president had done in living memory, all while acting like a brash ignoramus who didn’t care what anyone thought. When Biden was elected in 2020, the world could interpret 2016 as a hair-raising fluke and see Biden’s recommitment to the institutions the US anchors as a reaffirmation of the stability of the US itself and as a reliable actor in the world.

Re-electing Trump will be a permanent knockout blow for the belief of people and countries around the world that they know what the US stands for. That is just a fact. Trump repudiated the US-established, rule-based world order in favor of bi-lateral power relations. That plainly overthrows what the world previously expected of the US, and confirming it will turn the chaotic exception into the new rule.

And he demonstrated something even more destructive – that the rule of law doesn’t even apply domestically under Trump. He views himself as a king and will lay waste to our system of government if that’s what it takes to enact his will and launder his crimes. He has already done so.

What does it mean for the world to see a USA that not only disregards its own rules on the international stage – which it has always done selectively, while still maintaining the rule-based order in general – but now doesn’t even apply the rule of law internally? Trump willingly conceded to all the Putins and Xis and Kims of the world, who say that the US is just a hypocrite that talks about laws and human rights only out of self-interest, that they were right all along. He puffed out his chest and boasted of it – you think we’re such angels?

No, we were never angels, but we had laws. It was not just a show – the rule of law matters to us. “We the people” … actually believe that our constitution gives us rights and protections that no one has the right to take away. It’s the whole fucking idea.

Trump destroys that by telling all of us, everywhere in the world, that our rights and protections depend only on our proximity to power. It’s the antithesis of everything the US has ever claimed to represent.

His first term was a wake-up call, to Americans and to the rest of the world. This could happen. You could wake up one day and suddenly find that the biggest country that claims to stand for the rule of law and for human rights (never mind its shortcomings – it remained a work in progress) and stands as a bulwark against authoritarianism … is itself now a scofflaw that gives succor to dictators and strikes fear into the hearts of ALLIES.

This, Trump-voters, is what your vote to re-elect him will mean to the rest of us who don’t live in your alternate reality of self-serving bullshit. That you are A-OK with that litany of destruction and all of his promises to treat other people like “vermin” as long as you think the lifetime scam artist is going to deliver for you.

There’s no mulligan this time. If you don’t know better now, it’s because you don’t want to. There are no excuses left for you. There’s no going back when you’ve watched the shit play out over 10 years and heard the appeals of the people around you and decided you didn’t care. It’s a message that we will take to heart whether we want to or not, because it’s going to cost us and you didn’t give a damn",[0]

Heavenly Father, in the mighty name of Jesus, we come before You, asking for peace as our nation approaches this critical election. Calm the hearts and minds of Your people as they weigh the possibilities of various outcomes (Philippians 4:6-7). We ask that You prevent conflicts, disruptions, or dishonesty. Guard each person who steps into a polling place and cover them with Your divine protection. Let peace and safety prevail (Psalm 34:7).

We thank You, Lord, for the privilege of being citizens of this nation and for the foundations upon which it stands. We ask that You restore integrity to the institution of our elections. While men may seek to deceive out of selfishness and the lust for power, we trust in You, for You alone hold true power, and all authority is from You (Romans 13:1). We give You all the praise!

Grant wisdom to those deciding their votes so that their choices align with Your will and bring about the greatest good for our future (James 1:5). Let integrity and righteousness be present from the casting of ballots to the counting and reporting. Protect us from fraud and manipulation (Deuteronomy 16:20). Stir the hearts of those who are unmotivated or indifferent, inspiring them to fulfill their duty to vote. May the weight of this responsibility rest upon them.

Father, we also ask that You uncover lies and reveal the truth. Strengthen our pursuit of truth and confound the spirit of deceit and misinformation. We reject falsehoods and ask that they be exposed (Psalm 25:5). We rebuke satan, the father of lies, in Jesus’ name (John 8:44). Our trust is in You, and we declare today that ""Victory belongs to the Lord"" (Proverbs 21:31).

Lord, we pray that You deliver victory to the righteous, to the Republican Party, and to Donald Trump, that they may lead this nation back to truth and righteousness. We believe this victory is crucial to saving America and restoring it to the principles upon which it was founded. Guide our nation back to You, and let Your hand of justice and mercy prevail.

In Jesus' name we pray,
Amen.

4) The cost of everyday household items has surged nearly 20% under Kamala’s watch, with families now paying as much as 50% more at the gas pump.

5) Consumer prices have soared by 19.5% since Harris took office, a staggering 350% increase compared to Trump's tenure, revealing the depth of economic deterioration under her leadership.

As a candidate for U.S. Congress from Virginia's 10th district and a dedicated advocate for sensible policies, I've been closely studying the behavior of MAGA radicalized Republicans. It's become clear that these extremists have been heavily influenced, even brainwashed, by Russian tactics through Trump. This disturbing trend can be seen in the stark difference between their comments on my posts versus those from Democrats and civilized Republicans.

This manipulation undermines our democracy and the values we stand for as Americans. It's crucial to recognize and address this issue head-on to protect our nation from further division and foreign interference.

💪 I am committed to fighting for truth, integrity, and unity. Together, we can expose and counteract these extremist influences.

19,"TRUMP IS MENTALLY INCOMPETENT, MORALLY REPUGNANT AND A CRIMINAL – SO WHY AREN’T WE SAILING TO VICTORY? -- LOOK TO HISTORY
This election has an historic edge to it not only because Trump is historically awful and menacing. It’s also one of history’s potential turning points. Seeing similar currents around the world tells us that we are not just dealing with the domestic trends we observe, but something deeper and more fundamental. It is no coincidence that these echoes of the fascist past – and don’t dismiss the parallels: the path to nationalist bloodshed starts with words and the capture of institutions, not massacres – are crescendoing now, just as the living memory of WWII is dying away.

This blood-and-soil bullshit is an ineradicable, but deflectable, urge of human existence that lies dormant in the dark heart of humanity until the passage of generations has sufficiently blunted the memory of it and there is no one left – at least no one who still has any influence – who recognizes the early shoots of its return. People fall prey to it again and again not because they don’t care – it happens because they don’t believe it is happening until it’s well under way.

We are well past the beginning of it already when a person who whips up hatred as a tool of politics has held the presidency in this country, and who, with a phalanx of opportunists and toadies, is preparing to seize and permanently change our institutions. Like-minded figures, who all support each other and work to erode the domestic and international impediments to their transformative abuse of power, are in position around the world – a mutual admiration and support society of dictators and wannabes. Putin, Orbán, the rising nationalists throughout Europe, the goons around the world who regard human rights as an affront to their patriarchal sense of entitlement.

Joe Biden is one of the few world leaders left who is old enough to have grown up in the immediate aftermath of the war, and that has made him an invaluable leader in managing the threat of Russia, maintaining the NATO deterrent and understanding the undercurrents of world affairs. Trump, meanwhile, who grew up in the same period, has demonstrated how ignorant and useless he is – a man who could have known better, but whose lifelong dedication to learning and honing only what was necessary to feeding his own desires has instead cultivated an incorrigible stupidity and recklessness regarding everything that he was uninterested in learning about.

Joe Biden knows what the stakes are here, perhaps better than most of those who would replace him, though they are students of the same history even if their connection to it is more academic. But that wisdom should also tell him that many of the fateful decisions that led to disaster in the past were made by people who miscalculated in spite of being capable of knowing better. He should know that his value is in making the right decision, not being “the right person.” In 2020 the right decision was to be the person who was needed. Now the right decision is to see that he himself is putting the cause at risk.

In the end it will be up to us to make this moment a near miss instead of one of history’s calamitous turning points. The ancient elixir of intergroup hatred that is the basis of Trump’s appeal never leads to anything but violence in the end.

If Biden stays in the race, we’re going to have to work all the harder to win. And if he hands off to another ticket, it won’t be easy anyway. Either way, there is only one option compatible with our duty to avert disaster: VOTE FOR THE ONLY OPTION THAT WON’T GIVE US TRUMP: DEMOCRATS.",[0]

Does he act like Trump, corruptly intervening to quash the trial? Pardon his son? Denounce the trial and everyone associated with it as corrupt or out to get him? No – he acts like any decent citizen and lets the rule of law run its course.

This is reality, but everything’s the opposite with Trump and his toadies. Aside from their screw-job policies – do you want to live in a world where everything’s inverted, twisted, distorted? Where every true fact is constantly contested by megaphone liars with the reach to hoodwink millions; where it’s impossible to agree on anything – even things we can all see with our own eyes – because liars politicize everything? Do you want to live in a world where total frauds are telling us what the truth is? Where liars are called honest and normal people are called liars?

Forget our real-world differences, which would be the legitimate stuff of politics – a country can’t succeed if it is insane. And the stuff that many people in this country believe is bonkers. Yet the same people who think Joe Biden can’t say a sentence and craps his pants, and who think that the whole government has suddenly become corrupt and everything is falling apart even though everything in their lives is the same as it always was – these riled-up people will scream in your face that YOU’RE nuts, that YOU’RE brainwashed.

This insanity is unsustainable. It doesn’t work. We’re growing less competent and capable as a society with every passing day that Republican cynics keep lying on an industrial scale and keep demonizing all the rest of us – brainwashing THEMSELVES into believing things that remove any basis for working together – as a pretext for doing whatever they want.

Give me a slate of SANE REPUBLICANS WHO TELL THE TRUTH and I’ll support them, even though I disagree with every damn thread of their worldview, just to save the country, and the world, from the scourge of people who pollute our collective mind with systematic lies and cynicism.

We have to turn off the distortion to keep our society. That’s no hyperbole. Regimes based on lies first corrode the institutional obstacles to power, then impose their phony reality and rule by force, then use violence to enforce their incompetent rule, and ultimately destroy the society in war as the increasingly incompetent and violent society devolves into a fight over the spoils.

Republicans have, in a sense, basically just decided to skip ahead to the fight for the spoils because they don’t want to share the future with us even if it would be more prosperous – if they’re not solely in charge of it, they’d rather carve up the world they’re still just hanging onto than divvy up the future with all of us. They don’t even want to share reality with us, because the reality is that, together, they’re not calling all the shots anymore. So they’ve just built their own reality and they’re trying to make it win.

But that’s a betrayal of all the rest of us in society. And it’s a false promise to everyone who buys into it. Winning my ass – you can’t bestride the world when you’re committed to upholding lies. It holds you back, forces you into stupidities. You can’t outcompete serious competitors with a society based on validating whatever bullshit needs to be true to make sense out of a Trump speech.

It’s obvious this doesn’t work and never can work in the long run. The only reason it hasn’t ended in ruin already is because the society has a lot of assets to burn before it starts running ragged. Disagree all you want on where we want this country to go in a sane future, but we’re not going anywhere but down-in-flames if we hand this place back over to people who play politics by building a worldscape of bullshit.

34,"TRUMP’S COVID FAILURE WAS MONUMENTAL, EVEN BEYOND ALL THE LIVES LOST
Trump took a natural disaster – the greatest *opportunity* that can occur for a president – and turned it into a national tragedy, an engine of division instead of unity, and a political disaster for himself. The incompetence of that is astounding.

Many people, amazingly, seem to give Trump a *break* for Covid, as if he had been doing so well – reality check: an economy juiced by a giant tax cut yet still just continuing, not improving, the economic trendlines established by Obama –, only to be tripped up by bad luck. Hogwash. The chief job of any president is to handle the *hard* times well, not the easy ones.

More to the point, any decent person or halfway competent politician could have saved many lives and rallied the country behind them and been rewarded for it, just as George W. Bush’s basic humanity allowed 9/11 to be a moment of national unity and a political boon for him.

Trump shanked a gimme when the game was on the line.

Selfish as always and character-blind to the potential of unifying people instead of preying on division, Trump saw the emerging pandemic as a threat to his re-election and politicized it every step of the way instead of doing his job. What a knave, what a fool – with an ounce of decency or sense, he would have realized that he could skate to victory by simply appearing to care and rallying people to help each other out.

But we all know Trump doesn’t have it in him. He is incapable of rising to the occasion even when it would obviously benefit him.

Contrary to the bizarre assertion that his amorality is advantageous, being a bad person makes Trump an incompetent politician and a calamitous leader. His lack of moral intuition and understanding of mutual benefit equates to strategic stupidity in the context of the presidency, where the vast power of the office can be multiplied by a person with even a spark of wisdom and humanity – or wantonly squandered by a fool who sees it as an instrument of their own measly fate.

Trump came into office with a humming economy and left the country roiled with rage and its economy staggered by his bungling of the crisis. Biden came into the wreck Trump left and has put the country back on the trajectory of growth and investment in the future that Trump ended when he botched the only real challenge, and greatest opportunity, of his term. That’s how it is.

35,"Did you know? For those new to our club or its social media page-a brief history of what we DO. But first our story. In 2002 a handful of activists, including Debby Kerner, Sheila Blake and Alan Guttman got together and- tired of a red shaded community and county- formed Southwest Houston Democrats. Shortly after, having found a need for a deeper community focus , they named it Meyerland Area Democrats with Meyerland, Westbury, Maplewood and Marilyn Estates. And so it began...

It grew as more and more joined and starting inviting speakers, and learning how to do GOTV operations in these communities. Neighbor by neighbor grassroots activism at its finest rose. The club became known for being fierce fighters for progressives. A generation of leadership was trained in our club. The club has outgrown every space its occupied from Marco's to Escalante's to Fadi's and now Zoom/Facebook live.

Meyerland Area Democrats, besides having stellar programming which has brought in the movers and shakers in the Democratic party from not just Houston, but Texas and even nationally, has contributed in key ways via its organizing.

Our members in the past 3 cycles alone have made some 75,000 calls to voters, knocked on the doors of over 25,000 homes, written 50,000 postcards, raised thousands for the Harris County Democratic Party, the Texas Democratic Party, Annie's List, TOP, and has given to numerous local party clubs.

We are proud to say that the communities we serve have had their voter turnout rise to the top 1 percentile in turnout countywide, and our goal of turning these neighborhoods blue has succeeded. When President Pronin was sworn in for his 1st term in 2011 John Culberson was the congressman for much of our membership and community. Today it is Democrat Lizzie Fletcher. HD 134 voted Republican the entire ballot 10 years ago. Today HD134 is voting Democratic- by 30 points for Biden-and now has a Democratic State Rep. Ann Johnson.

Our new Democratic congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher-took her rise in the forum we hosted in January 2017. Many new activists post Trump's election came to our club to get connected- and grew networks into Swing Left and others who won the race. Without Meyerland Area Democrats having organized these communities for years such a victory would have been even more difficult.
Also to note-in 2015 our club was key in Mayor Turner's win- in a race won by 4,000 votes. We even got an office from Turner in Westbury. We staged numerous canvass events, created and funded mailers, and much more. We were front and center in that key fight.

Some other highlights include hosting Beto O'Rourke twice, the second townhall we did at Westbury High School with 1,600 guests is the largest gathering of progressives in the history of Westbury! Other programming highlights include: James Carville, Mayors Turner, Parker, and Lee Brown. We are also proud of tackling complex issues and pressing for conversations in the community- ie Black Lives Matter, GLBT rights, public education, teachins on various issues . We have partnered with many of our county clubs including Swing Left, HBAD, ROAD Women, TDW Harris, Houston Young Stonewall Dems, Harris County Young Democrats, Bayou Blue Dems, Bellaire-Braes Democrats , Sharpstown Democrats (and many more). Call us forum gurus- as our forums have set the standard for fairness and attendance.

To the thousands of you who have through our club over the years thank you. The work of our membership, as it is in all our clubs, is that of great personal sacrifice. 22 years in and our organization has become one which is seen as our state's premiere organizations for the party. We also happen to represent the largest number of Jewish American Democrats of any local club in the state!

As someone who understands the difficulties of legally immigrating to the US, she worked hard to learn English and respect the laws as the American thing to do. She sees illegal immigration as a disservice to those who have gone through the proper channels to become Americans.

43,"Statement from Rutherford GOP Chairman Austin Maxwell on the Assassination Attempt on 45th President of the United States: Donald J Trump.

A Testimony of God's Grace and Protection

I am writing this to express my shock and sorrow over the assassination attempt on our former President Donald J Trump, who was shot by an assassin on July 13, 2024, while he was delivering a speech at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. I am also writing to offer my prayers and condolences to the former President, his family, and the other victims of this heinous act of violence. I pray that God will heal their wounds, comfort their hearts, and grant them peace and justice.

As a loyal supporter and admirer of President Trump, I have always appreciated his courage, honesty, and patriotism. He has been a champion of the American people, a defender of our constitutional rights, and a leader who has fought tirelessly to make our country great again. He has faced unprecedented opposition, hostility, and betrayal from the corrupt and dishonest media, the radical and socialist Democrats, and the deep state and globalist elites. He has endured countless attacks, lies, and slanders, but he has never given up or backed down. He has always stood up for what is right and true, and he has always put America first. As he walked off the podium yesterday with his spilled blood on his face, he again encouraged us as Americans to move forward and to fight for our democracy and we must continue to do so!

That is why I believe that God has a special plan and purpose for President Trump, and that he has not finished his work on this earth. I believe that God was watching over him on that fateful day, and that he spared his life by a miracle. I believe that God has more to reveal and accomplish through President Trump, and that he will use him to expose the evil and corruption that has plagued our nation and our world. I believe that President Trump is a chosen instrument of God, and that he will fulfill his destiny and his calling when he is re-elected as President on November 5th, 2024.

As Chairman of the local GOP, I can relate to President Trump's situation, because I have also experienced God's grace and protection in a similar way. On March 29th, 2006, while fighting the enemies of freedom in Afghanistan I too was grazed by a bullet to my face during a firefight with evil. If I had been to my left one inch I would not be here today. My fellow soldiers & doctors told me that I was very lucky, and that it was a miracle that I was alive.

But I know that it was not luck or coincidence, but God's hand that saved me. I know that God was watching over me, and that he had a reason for sparing my life. God knew that my family would need me 7 years later with the tragic passing of my son and I believe that God knows that our nation needs the former President now more than ever and that is why he was protecting him yesterday and will continue to protect him.

As Republicans we support the democratic process, and we encourage all voters to make their voice be heard by supporting their candidates in a respectful and peaceful way. We condemn the violence and senseless tragedy that occurred yesterday, and we stand united behind our candidate and future President Donald J. Trump. As President Trump has stated this morning that we will not fear but instead remain resilient in our faith and defiant in the face of Wickedness. Our love and prayers go out to the victims and their families, and we will pray for the recovery of those wounded and hold in our hearts the memory of the citizen who was killed tragically. In this moment, it is more important that ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win.

In conclusion, I want to say that I am grateful and thankful to God for his grace and protection over my life and over President Trump's life. I want to say that I am praying and hoping for President Trump's full and speedy recovery, and for his continued leadership and influence in our nation and our world. I want to say that I am standing with President Trump, and that I will always support and defend him against his enemies and his critics.

May God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America!

Respectfully,

Austin K. Maxwell

44,"Donald Trump and his campaign are imploding. His poll numbers are plummeting, including in the key swing states.

Rumors are swirling that he is about to fire at least one of his top campaign advisors. He is deeply regretting his pick for VP. He is on the defense. His back is against the wall - and doesn't know how to handle it.

He will only become more deranged and unhinged, which will lead to an even deeper collapse of his campaign.

Buckle up and grab your popcorn.",[27]
45,"Today marks an unprecedented corruption of our justice system and a very dark day for America. We have witnessed a blatant action to imprison a Presidential nominee and steal the election out of the hands of the voters. A corrupt prosecutor, a corrupt judge, and a corrupt jury conspired to undermine our democracy in a manner more fitting of a banana republic than the United States of America.

George Soros bankrolled Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, acting as a useful idiot for Biden, has manipulated the legal system to serve the interests of the radical Left. It is an egregious abuse of power aimed solely at keeping President Trump out of the White House. Every American should be deeply concerned and have serious doubts about the integrity of our judicial system after what we have seen today. This miscarriage of justice is not just an attack on President Trump but also on our democracy and the very principles that our nation was founded upon.

I stand fully behind President Trump and reject this sham trial just like the Appellate Division will. The real verdict will come on November 5th when the people vote to send Trump back to the White House.","[10, 16, 24]"
46,"Strategy—a plan of action or policy designed to achieve a major or overall aim.

Military leaders will tell you if you don’t get the big-picture overall strategy right, you aren’t going to win. Today neither the Republican Party nor the Democratic Party have as their big-picture strategy the use of government to make America stronger, more prosperous and a happier place. And as a result the American people sure aren’t winning.

Ironically the strategies of Democrat and Republican elected officials are very similar, just similarly wrong. Their strategies are to raise obscene amounts of money, win elections…not as a means to the end of governing well but as an end in itself…in order to raise even more money and entrench themselves in even more power. As we are all aware, in too many cases they are still doing this long after they have principally become sclerotic tools of lobbyists and donors. Many have become too cowardly to do what they believe in their hearts would be good for America, but bad for their political careers. Others don’t even know or care what they think is right, having gotten elected and thriving in Washington by not paying attention to such old-fashioned, quaint values.

Voters need to stop this. We need to elect pragmatic, consensus-oriented public servants. We need to recognize that about half of us see issues very differently than the other half of us. We need to pay attention to the fact that history has demonstrated over the last few decades that neither side is going to prevail over the other.

More voters need to take an “Um, I could live with that” approach to politics, and insist their elected officials do the same. We need to insist that, regardless of their political views, our politicians be sensible, and endeavor to work with others to get things done. The alternative is likely more of the circus that most of us despise, and a continuing grinding down of our nation.

****
Note to those who have been kind enough to follow The Lone Liberal Republican project over the years. I am posting a lot less currently because it seems to me that until the upcoming elections are over, it is difficult to know how to frame posts. If President Biden is re-elected, especially with a Democratic Congress, the framing will most likely need to be about how to rebuild at least a portion of the Republican Party in more pragmatic, consensus-oriented directions. If President Trump prevails, especially with a Republican Congress, the focus will likely be about how to harness the energies of people of both or neither parties whose views, like mine, are centrist, again towards finding our way to a more pragmatic, consensus-oriented place.

As always, thanks for reading and be well.",[0]

50,"A Post of Warning in Response to the Demise of the GOP

What scares me is that there were many, many Germans who saw what was happening as Hitler and the Nazis fought for power. They either spoke out or fled. But a significant minority (the Nazis) was committed to gaining power and the majority kept seeking reassurance that the fear was hysteria. And the only way it ended was Germany in ruins, partioned and governed by the nations who were forced to wage war in self defense by which time the Germans finally had to face the reality of what their decisions and acquiescence had led to.

That is what sends cold shivers of terror through my spine - the knowledge that we humans can’t face reality until we are forced to. Until then we are satisfied with the lies and obfuscations because those are more comfortable than the truth.

If Trump wins, the first thing that’ll happen are the arrests of opposition leadership and senior civil service. The majority will feel uncomfortable but will stay quiet because “they’re only getting arrested because they committed a crime.” That attitude and belief has become ingrained in us after 50 years of the carceral state operating on greater and greater budgets. People being arrested and imprisoned over bullshit is just an accepted practice.

When they begin operating an active political police force, people will see their neighbors carted off and will think, “better them than me.” They will justify those acts by saying to themselves, “well, I never really liked that asshole and it’s about time he/she got busted for it.”

Then they’ll realize they have to show pride and enthusiasm and every household will fly the MAGA flag.

When the teachers start teaching our kids the propaganda we’ll have the same problem as the Germans - the sudden fear of parents that their kids will turn them in because those kids will be taught to venerate Trump and MAGA above all else.

And that is the precise moment the majority of Germans realized how fucked they were. And that was when the midnight arrests and disappearances began and they all suddenly realized that any of them could disappear in a heartbeat for anything.

And thus does the state become father, mother, protector and persecutor and the only chance of safety is total abasement before the party and leadership.

And that’s the root of my fear - the understanding that the majority of us go through life in denial of the facts presented. I’ve always considered it the supreme superpower we have. To stand before reality and say, “I refuse to believe because it does not make me feel good.”

I’ve watched countless people walk themselves into prison, lose their children and destroy their lives because they can’t let go of their denial in the face of their reality. They’d rather believe the lie and have their children taken from them forever then to face the reality and have a shot at putting their family back together.

Because overcoming the denial requires our other great superpower - faith in ourselves.

52,"TRUMP-VOTERS: DON’T FOOL YOURSELVES ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF RE-ELECTING HIM. THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT RUNS OUT WHEN A CHOICE IS CONFIRMED
That goes for personal relationships and it goes for the way the US is seen by people around the world. You Trump-voters have been on a 10-year journey to reconcile yourselves with violating your own standards for personal gain. And you have a lot of fellow travelers on the same train to make you feel validated in your choice. It’s easy for many of you to ignore or dismiss how your journey is viewed by the people who aren’t on it with you. But the rest of us have not spent 10 years trying to rationalize Trump. We’ve been looking on with the same disgust we felt for him all along, and for the spectacle of watching you talk yourselves into a Faustian bargain by demonizing all the rest of us.

Trump’s loss in 2020 meant that all of us could let bygones be bygones for the sake of getting along with loved ones and other people in our lives. But then you let the scumbag back in. And if you vote for him again after all the shit he did in office, after trying to overturn the 2020 election and after all the repulsive shit he’s said and done since then, the message received by everyone outside of your self-deluding bubble is going to be a thousand times worse than it was in 2016 or even 2020. It will be a confirmation.

This is not a threat – it’s the weary foresight of knowing how it feels to see people make an “eff-you” choice in full knowledge of the consequences for others. Like watching a loved one return to a relationship-harming habit, listening to their rationalizations for indulging themselves again … It’s one thing to make a mistake. It’s quite another to ratify it again later.

That’s a personal angle, but the same thing goes for the view of the US around the world. People across the world shook their heads in 2016 and looked on with dismay and disbelief as Trump destabilized every institution of world affairs and raised doubts about US commitments in a way that no president had done in living memory, all while acting like a brash ignoramus who didn’t care what anyone thought. When Biden was elected in 2020, the world could interpret 2016 as a hair-raising fluke and see Biden’s recommitment to the institutions the US anchors as a reaffirmation of the stability of the US itself and as a reliable actor in the world.

Re-electing Trump will be a permanent knockout blow for the belief of people and countries around the world that they know what the US stands for. That is just a fact. Trump repudiated the US-established, rule-based world order in favor of bi-lateral power relations. That plainly overthrows what the world previously expected of the US, and confirming it will turn the chaotic exception into the new rule.

And he demonstrated something even more destructive – that the rule of law doesn’t even apply domestically under Trump. He views himself as a king and will lay waste to our system of government if that’s what it takes to enact his will and launder his crimes. He has already done so.

What does it mean for the world to see a USA that not only disregards its own rules on the international stage – which it has always done selectively, while still maintaining the rule-based order in general – but now doesn’t even apply the rule of law internally? Trump willingly conceded to all the Putins and Xis and Kims of the world, who say that the US is just a hypocrite that talks about laws and human rights only out of self-interest, that they were right all along. He puffed out his chest and boasted of it – you think we’re such angels?

No, we were never angels, but we had laws. It was not just a show – the rule of law matters to us. “We the people” … actually believe that our constitution gives us rights and protections that no one has the right to take away. It’s the whole fucking idea.

Trump destroys that by telling all of us, everywhere in the world, that our rights and protections depend only on our proximity to power. It’s the antithesis of everything the US has ever claimed to represent.

His first term was a wake-up call, to Americans and to the rest of the world. This could happen. You could wake up one day and suddenly find that the biggest country that claims to stand for the rule of law and for human rights (never mind its shortcomings – it remained a work in progress) and stands as a bulwark against authoritarianism … is itself now a scofflaw that gives succor to dictators and strikes fear into the hearts of ALLIES.

This, Trump-voters, is what your vote to re-elect him will mean to the rest of us who don’t live in your alternate reality of self-serving bullshit. That you are A-OK with that litany of destruction and all of his promises to treat other people like “vermin” as long as you think the lifetime scam artist is going to deliver for you.

There’s no mulligan this time. If you don’t know better now, it’s because you don’t want to. There are no excuses left for you. There’s no going back when you’ve watched the shit play out over 10 years and heard the appeals of the people around you and decided you didn’t care. It’s a message that we will take to heart whether we want to or not, because it’s going to cost us and you didn’t give a damn.",[0]

JOE BACKS OUT

KAMALA SURGES

I think it is easy to believe that when things are going your way, things will just continue apace. For the moment, all eyes are on Kamala and Walz, seeing their stardom glitter on the pollster's screen. It feels so good to finally feel good about a politician that all the attendant misery is forgotten.

And we probably need moments like this. For those days the magic feels distant, the rush of good feelings is hanging back, or we just feel lost and desperate for hope. We remember when it felt good and we remember why it felt good. We realize hope never dies.

Trump seems to have decided to embody the criticism he'd just been laying on Biden. He seems tired, he rambles incoherently at his public events, the Right Wing media seems to just be floundering, trying to figure out how MAGA suddenly lost the forward momentum. For many on the Left, and in the Center, and some on the Right - it seems simple to say Trump is done.

Maybe he is. Maybe all it really took to defang his nastiness was to put up the very personage he's spent his entire life hating - a Black Woman. His tender sensibilities must just be eating themselves alive in his head. I mean, its one thing to lose to another old, rich white man but to lose to a black woman? Oh, thank you Universe, this is the schadenfreude we need.

I am all for it. I am 100% in support of this ride.

So 2024 is headed to go down as one of the most critical moments in history. The hand off of power has begun and some are still committed to stopping that from happening. And it could, that's why I caution against giving in fully to the good feelings being generated. Trump is wounded at the moment but that won't last forever. He still has the violence card to play, he still has his potential allies for setting up conditions to steal power and that's why I advise caution.

A cornered animal is the most dangerous. It has nothing left to lose. What position do you think Trump is in?

Voting for her is voting for a potential arms embargo on Israel right in the middle of an existential war.

Voting for her is voting for a ceasefire with Hamas and Hezbollah and another 10/7 in a few years from now.

Voting for her is voting for more dead Jews.

Harsh? Sometimes the truth is harsh but it still needs to be said.

It wasn’t the “undecided” ones who broke one way – it was EVERY SINGLE PERSON who broke that way. And it’s obviously pointless to talk to the weather-vane-brained nimrods who can’t decide between a normal person and a deranged hatemonger. I want to talk to the smart people out there who have a damn good reason to be pissed off at the very thought of Trump winning.

That mean-hearted bastard is going to rule like he has a mandate to be the eternal king even if he loses the popular vote by millions – just like he did in 2016. That fucker got 3 million less votes than Hillary and what did he do? He took away the constitutional right to an abortion that has been supported by 60-70% of the population for 50 years. He took away women’s autonomy and has been bragging about it ever since. He tried to bribe a foreign leader to produce dirt on his election opponent using funds appropriated by congress. He tried to overthrow the election he lost. He sat on his fat ass doing nothing for several hours while a mob he incited was chanting to hang Mike Pence and beating up police in the capitol. He treated our allies like shit and dictators like a love-sick groupie who wanted to be admired by the worst people in the world. He separated children from their families at the border, some of which have still not been reunited with their parents for fuck sake. He instituted a “Muslim ban” and he talked about people from Haiti and Africa as being from “shithole countries.”

What the hell do you think he means by shithole? He means that the people from there are shit, and that’s exactly what he thinks of the people who are already Americans whose ancestors were stolen from those places. The man talks constantly about “genes” and the blood of the country being “poisoned” by people who don’t have good genes. You want a fucking Nazi president? What kind of genes do you think he favors? Where do you think that’s headed?

The pig has been found by two juries to have raped a woman and he’s been credibly accused by tens of others of doing exactly what he personally bragged about doing on the Access Hollywood tape. “When you’re a celebrity they let you do it,” said the swine. He mocks disabled people. He was reported by a decorated general whom he personally selected to be his Chief of Staff of calling WWII dead “suckers.” He is a piece of shit from top to bottom and you have to be an absolute schmuck if you’re a woman, a minority or any other person who gives a shit about human rights and human dignity to vote for a man who has proven over his whole life that he has no respect for anyone but roguish White men who do and take whatever they want.

DO NOT VOTE FOR THAT FUCKER! YOU WILL REGRET IT! WE WILL ALL REGRET IT – even the dumbasses who think he’s on their team. The law and the constitution are there to PROTECT AGAINST a person like him, because if you get someone who will break the system to do what he wants, it doesn’t matter if you think he’s on your team or not. Sooner or later someone else will use the power he usurped to fuck you over and the safeguards that used to protect all of us will be gone.

65,"Strategy—a plan of action or policy designed to achieve a major or overall aim.

Military leaders will tell you if you don’t get the big-picture overall strategy right, you aren’t going to win. Today neither the Republican Party nor the Democratic Party have as their big-picture strategy the use of government to make America stronger, more prosperous and a happier place. And as a result the American people sure aren’t winning.

Ironically the strategies of Democrat and Republican elected officials are very similar, just similarly wrong. Their strategies are to raise obscene amounts of money, win elections…not as a means to the end of governing well but as an end in itself…in order to raise even more money and entrench themselves in even more power. As we are all aware, in too many cases they are still doing this long after they have principally become sclerotic tools of lobbyists and donors. Many have become too cowardly to do what they believe in their hearts would be good for America, but bad for their political careers. Others don’t even know or care what they think is right, having gotten elected and thriving in Washington by not paying attention to such old-fashioned, quaint values.

Voters need to stop this. We need to elect pragmatic, consensus-oriented public servants. We need to recognize that about half of us see issues very differently than the other half of us. We need to pay attention to the fact that history has demonstrated over the last few decades that neither side is going to prevail over the other.

More voters need to take an “Um, I could live with that” approach to politics, and insist their elected officials do the same. We need to insist that, regardless of their political views, our politicians be sensible, and endeavor to work with others to get things done. The alternative is likely more of the circus that most of us despise, and a continuing grinding down of our nation.

Note to those who have been kind enough to follow The Lone Liberal Republican project over the years. I am posting a lot less currently because it seems to me that until the upcoming elections are over, it is difficult to know how to frame posts. If President Biden is re-elected, especially with a Democratic Congress, the framing will most likely need to be about how to rebuild at least a portion of the Republican Party in more pragmatic, consensus-oriented directions. If President Trump prevails, especially with a Republican Congress, the focus will likely be about how to harness the energies of people of both or neither parties whose views, like mine, are centrist, again towards finding our way to a more pragmatic, consensus-oriented place.

Both men, Trump & Biden have been president for 4 years & the record is clear.
One man is a self made billionaire patriot who loves his country & the other man, is a charlatan, demagogue who sold his country for money !
One man is a strong , well spoken, energetic non politician & the other a corrupt , failed, career politician who has never held a job in his life !
One man is an effective domestic & foreign policy leader, the other is a feeble, imposter, wishy washy body with severe cognitive failure & mental disability.
After experiencing these approximate 8 years & the performance & record of each man, no one should be in doubt for even a second, that Trump is by far the better man for the job !
The democrat machinery & the fake, main stream media industrial complex will tell you otherwise & spin the truth but do not be fooled or tricked by their propaganda or their treachery !","[29, 30]"
71,"THE INSANE SPLIT-SCREEN OF TRUMP-ERA USA: As Trump and Republicans claim that the law and all of government have been weaponized against them when Trump is held accountable for crimes and misconduct that they would be appalled by if they weren’t the perpetrators (“lawfare” – what a joke), and they ridiculously parrot that Biden is the most corrupt and inept president in history (projection alert) … Biden’s son goes to trial on federal gun charges brought by the Department of Justice that Republicans have claimed is corrupt under Biden (projection alarm blaring). -- And what does Biden do? Does he act like Trump, corruptly intervening to quash the trial? Pardon his son? Denounce the trial and everyone associated with it as corrupt or out to get him? No – he acts like any decent citizen and lets the rule of law run its course.

This is reality, but everything’s the opposite with Trump and his toadies. Aside from their screw-job policies – do you want to live in a world where everything’s inverted, twisted, distorted? Where every true fact is constantly contested by megaphone liars with the reach to hoodwink millions; where it’s impossible to agree on anything – even things we can all see with our own eyes – because liars politicize everything? Do you want to live in a world where total frauds are telling us what the truth is? Where liars are called honest and normal people are called liars?

Forget our real-world differences, which would be the legitimate stuff of politics – a country can’t succeed if it is insane. And the stuff that many people in this country believe is bonkers. Yet the same people who think Joe Biden can’t say a sentence and craps his pants, and who think that the whole government has suddenly become corrupt and everything is falling apart even though everything in their lives is the same as it always was – these riled-up people will scream in your face that YOU’RE nuts, that YOU’RE brainwashed.

This insanity is unsustainable. It doesn’t work. We’re growing less competent and capable as a society with every passing day that Republican cynics keep lying on an industrial scale and keep demonizing all the rest of us – brainwashing THEMSELVES into believing things that remove any basis for working together – as a pretext for doing whatever they want.

Give me a slate of SANE REPUBLICANS WHO TELL THE TRUTH and I’ll support them, even though I disagree with every damn thread of their worldview, just to save the country, and the world, from the scourge of people who pollute our collective mind with systematic lies and cynicism.

We have to turn off the distortion to keep our society. That’s no hyperbole. Regimes based on lies first corrode the institutional obstacles to power, then impose their phony reality and rule by force, then use violence to enforce their incompetent rule, and ultimately destroy the society in war as the increasingly incompetent and violent society devolves into a fight over the spoils.

Republicans have, in a sense, basically just decided to skip ahead to the fight for the spoils because they don’t want to share the future with us even if it would be more prosperous – if they’re not solely in charge of it, they’d rather carve up the world they’re still just hanging onto than divvy up the future with all of us. They don’t even want to share reality with us, because the reality is that, together, they’re not calling all the shots anymore. So they’ve just built their own reality and they’re trying to make it win.

But that’s a betrayal of all the rest of us in society. And it’s a false promise to everyone who buys into it. Winning my ass – you can’t bestride the world when you’re committed to upholding lies. It holds you back, forces you into stupidities. You can’t outcompete serious competitors with a society based on validating whatever bullshit needs to be true to make sense out of a Trump speech.

It’s obvious this doesn’t work and never can work in the long run. The only reason it hasn’t ended in ruin already is because the society has a lot of assets to burn before it starts running ragged. Disagree all you want on where we want this country to go in a sane future, but we’re not going anywhere but down-in-flames if we hand this place back over to people who play politics by building a worldscape of bullshit.

74,"ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE HAS CHOSEN TO BENEFIT THE WEALTHY! BUT NOT THE LITTLE GUY!

Sheldon Whitehouse has been in the Senate for 18 years, and he wants us to believe that in all those years, despite filibuster proof majorities in Congress, he just hasn’t been able to clean up the loopholes in our tax code. He must think we are mushrooms!

When the Republicans and President Trump passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2018, they include a provision capping SALT, the State and Local Tax deduction. The previous unlimited SALT deduction generously benefited wealthy individuals in high taxed states and transferred the federal tax burden to the working class in lower taxed states.

The new cap in the TCJA limited the amount of money a taxpayer could claim on their federal tax filing for state and local taxes to $10,000. Now for most of us taxpayers, that’s easy. But if you are wealthy and pay state income taxes and have expensive homes that are also high taxed, it was an unwelcome change. Those wealthy taxpayers could no longer deduct their elevated state income and property taxes. They were required to pay more taxes to the federal government, and they were angry.

Closing the SALT loophole meant that the federal government brought in more revenue from high income earners. That money was used to give middle class taxpayers a tax cut. The average family was able to keep $2000 in their paychecks, money that they are using to make their lives better.

To hear the Democrats talk about it, you would think that the wealthy were the ones that benefited the most. But that just isn’t true. Average taxpayers kept more of the money they work so hard to earn.

Two years ago, Sheldon had the opportunity to keep the SALT cap as part of the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax code changes. Shamelessly, he chose to let the cap expire, thereby reopening the loophole that Trump had closed. The wealthy now stand to benefit from a huge tax break in 2025.

Sheldon has made sure that the high-income earners that he rails against get to deduct those state and local taxes from their federal income tax returns once again. It’s the opposite of what he would have us believe.

There are other taxes that he has promised to increase. Eliminating the step-up in cost basis on estates in one of the most insidious. Older Americans have built up substantial wealth in their homes and retirement savings. Sheldon Whitehouse wants a big chunk of it. He intends to seize it from heirs using changes in the estate tax. He already voted for it in 2021. The bill failed by only 2 votes. Sheldon won’t let that happen again if the Democrats have a larger majority.

The step up in cost basis means that heirs don’t pay income taxes on the home or assets that their parents leave to them. When people own a home for 30-40 years it can easily appreciate by $400,000 or more, especially in the current high inflation environment.

Democrats wanted to tax that gain at 44%. Under that scenario, an heir would have to pay $176,000 to keep their parent’s home. In most cases, it would mean they would have to borrow. That’s a huge burden to place on a family. Sheldon already voted for it in 2021; he will gladly vote for it again.

Don’t pretend the wealthy will suffer. They will have accountants and attorneys to secure their homes and assets from the tax man. But everyday people will not. Kamala Harris agrees with Sheldon, she intends to make changes to the estate tax to raise more government revenue. Together she and Sheldon have plans that will impose hardship on everyday Rhode Island families.

The dishonesty with which Sheldon Whitehouse declares that he wants to tax only those making over $400,000 is stunning. His actions tell a different story.",[0]

FACTS:

1) Harris backed downgrading illegal border crossings to a civil offense, weakening our defenses against serious criminals.

2) Under Harris, illegal immigrant crime has spread across the nation, with skyrocketing rates of theft, assault, and even murder.

3) As a Senator, Kamala Harris tried to take $220 million out of ICE’s Enforcement Division.

4) The cost of everyday household items has surged nearly 20% under Kamala’s watch, with families now paying as much as 50% more at the gas pump.

5) Consumer prices have soared by 19.5% since Harris took office, a staggering 350% increase compared to Trump's tenure, revealing the depth of economic deterioration under her leadership.

76,"Dear Truthout Community,

If you feel rage, despondency, confusion and deep fear today, you are not alone. We’re feeling it too. We are heartsick. Facing down Trump’s fascist agenda, we are desperately worried about the most vulnerable people among us, including our loved ones and everyone in the Truthout community, and our minds are racing a million miles a minute to try to map out all that needs to be done.

We must give ourselves space to grieve and feel our fear, feel our rage, and keep in the forefront of our mind the stark truth that millions of real human lives are on the line. And simultaneously, we’ve got to get to work, take stock of our resources, and prepare to throw ourselves full force into the movement.

Journalism is a linchpin of that movement. Even as we are reeling, we’re shoring up all the energy we can to face down what’s coming, because we know that one of the sharpest weapons against fascism is publishing the truth.

There are many terrifying planks to the Trump agenda, and we plan to devote ourselves to reporting thoroughly on each one and, crucially, covering the movements resisting them. We also recognize that Trump is a dire threat to journalism itself, and that we must take this seriously from the outset.

Last week, the four of us sat down to have some hard but necessary conversations about Truthout if Trump were to win. How would we defend our publication from an avalanche of far right lawsuits that seek to bankrupt us? How would we keep our reporters safe if they need to cover outbreaks of political violence, or if they are targeted by authorities? How would we urgently produce the practical analysis, tools and movement coverage that you need right now -- breaking through our normal routines to meet a terrifying moment in ways that best serve you?

It will be a tough, scary four years to produce social justice-driven journalism. We need to deliver news, strategy, liberatory ideas, tools and movement-sparking solutions with a force like never before. And at the same time, we desperately need to protect our ability to do so.

We know this is such a painful moment and donations may understandably be the last thing on your mind. But we must ask for your support, which is needed in a new and urgent way.

We promise we will kick into an even higher gear to give you truthful news that cuts against the disinformation and vitriol and hate and violence. We promise to publish analyses that will serve the needs of the movements we all rely on to survive the next four years, and even build for the future. We promise to be responsive, to recognize you as members of our community with a vital stake and voice in this work.

Please dig deep if you can. A donation of any amount will be a truly meaningful and tangible action in this cataclysmic historical moment.



We’re with you. Let’s do all we can to move forward together.

With love, rage, and solidarity,
Maya, Negin, Saima, and Ziggy",[0]

GIVE THESE OBSERVATIONS SOME VERY SERIOUS THOUGHT BEFORE YOU VOTE.

First, this reminder: Trump himself said when he ran for office in 2016 that he was ""going to surround myself with only the best and most serious people.""

FROM 4 STAR ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Marine GENERAL James Mattis, hired by Trump as Secretary of Defense: "" [Trump] has no moral compass; a misguided form of nationalism; beyond stupid to felony stupid"" and that's when I resigned.

FROM 4 STAR ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Army GENERAL Mark Milley, served as Trump's Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff: ""We don't take an oath to an individual, we take an oath to the Constitution. [Trump] is a wannabe dictator.""

FROM 4 STAR ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Marine GENERAL John Kelly, hired by Trump to be his personal Chief of Staff: ""[Trump] is a deeply dishonest person who has no idea what America stands for. The most flawed person I've ever met.""

FROM 4 STAR ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Army GENERAL H.R. McMaster, hired by Trump as his National Security Advisor: ""[Trump's] failure to condemn white supremacy “gives space to these groups that foment hatred and intolerance.”

FROM Dan Coats, hired by Trump as his Director of National Intelligence (two photos, sorry): ""He doesn't know the difference between the truth and a lie.""

FROM 4 STAR ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Navy Admiral William McCraven, Commander, US Special Operations, Seal Commander who took out Osama bin Laden and coordinated the capture of Sadaam Hussein: Trump's comments ""may be the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime.""

FROM 4 STAR ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ ARMY GENERAL Barry McCaffrey. He received three Purple Heart medals for injuries sustained during his service in the Vietnam War, two Silver Stars, and two Distinguished Service Crosses—the second-highest United States Army award for valor. He was inducted into United States Army Ranger Hall of Fame at the United States Army Infantry Center :
[Trump] ""is a serious threat to USA national security.""

CIA Director Gina Haspel, Trump's CIA choice: Haspel said Trump's post-election behavior was 'insanity' and he was 'acting out like a 6-year-old with a tantrum.""

These statements are all in the public domain and can be easily verified.

IF THESE PROVEN LEADERS, HIGHLY QUALIFIED, HIGHLY DECORATED, COMBAT PROVEN WARRIORS ARE SAYING THESE THINGS ABOUT Trump, DOES IT REALLY MAKE SENSE TO BE VOTING FOR HIM, OR THOSE WHO SUPPORT HIM? Seems pretty illogical, right?

87,"EVERY IMMIGRANT IS MORE AMERICAN THAN TRUMP
The only thing “American” about Trump is his brand of tackiness. In every other way he is indistinguishable from sociopathic conmen from anywhere. His ethnonationalist ideas are imported from Europe. His admiration for dictators is about the most un-American thing imaginable. His instrumentalization of lying, demonizing his rivals, whipping up disgust and hatred to win the support of one group as defined against another are from an ancient playbook that is as generic as Trump’s smarmy smirk.

Every showman-demagogue plays to his particular audience, but Trump is no more authentic than a Beantown crooner who yells “I love you [checks notes] Cleveland!” He talks about “Making America Great” because his concert-revival-Klan-rally roadshow is touring America and it’s the only place his American-styled shtick would work. If he could pull it off, he’d “Make Australia Great” just as willingly, because it’s all about him anyway. (Just imagine if, 20 years ago, Trump had somehow become more famous in another country than in the US – does anyone think he would give a damn about the US at this point? He’d be talking about what a bunch of losers we are for not recognizing his specialness.)

America is a land of immigrants. More than that, it is a land of people from everywhere. That is its unique strength. Trump’s Old-World nationalism is the ultimate self-own. What makes America smart, innovative and resilient is our pluralism – having to jostle and compete with and learn from people who think and live differently in order to succeed.

Trump might want to break into the old money like some pathetic nouveau-riche wannabe begging to get into the country club, but America should be itself and stick to what it’s better at than other places – continuous renewal. Letting newcomers be a part of the country – engaging in the interplay between what people already love about it and new stuff that people come to love –instead of treating them like perpetual foreign objects. The assimilation that nativists always demand of newcomers is actually about the attitude of the receiving society – people don’t assimilate when society says “nope, you’ll never be part of us, just give us your cheap labor.” Just ask Europe how that works out. We do it better – or at least we used to.

That’s Trump’s musty, stupid idea of making America great. What a joke. The reality is that America is better than him, and it’s because that ancient shit, while ever-present, has never won the day.

America is a New-World country with a new kind of society – a mishmash of everyone. That’s the secret to the country’s success, the thing that sets America apart. It’s the reason the US can outcompete countries that no foreigners want to live in, or where they can only ever be outsiders looking in on a society that won’t accept them.

88,"Dear Truthout Community,

If you feel rage, despondency, confusion and deep fear today, you are not alone. We’re feeling it too. We are heartsick. Facing down Trump’s fascist agenda, we are desperately worried about the most vulnerable people among us, including our loved ones and everyone in the Truthout community, and our minds are racing a million miles a minute to try to map out all that needs to be done.

We must give ourselves space to grieve and feel our fear, feel our rage, and keep in the forefront of our mind the stark truth that millions of real human lives are on the line. And simultaneously, we’ve got to get to work, take stock of our resources, and prepare to throw ourselves full force into the movement.

Journalism is a linchpin of that movement. Even as we are reeling, we’re shoring up all the energy we can to face down what’s coming, because we know that one of the sharpest weapons against fascism is publishing the truth.

There are many terrifying planks to the Trump agenda, and we plan to devote ourselves to reporting thoroughly on each one and, crucially, covering the movements resisting them. We also recognize that Trump is a dire threat to journalism itself, and that we must take this seriously from the outset.

Last week, the four of us sat down to have some hard but necessary conversations about Truthout if Trump were to win. How would we defend our publication from an avalanche of far right lawsuits that seek to bankrupt us? How would we keep our reporters safe if they need to cover outbreaks of political violence, or if they are targeted by authorities? How would we urgently produce the practical analysis, tools and movement coverage that you need right now -- breaking through our normal routines to meet a terrifying moment in ways that best serve you?

It will be a tough, scary four years to produce social justice-driven journalism. We need to deliver news, strategy, liberatory ideas, tools and movement-sparking solutions with a force like never before. And at the same time, we desperately need to protect our ability to do so.

We know this is such a painful moment and donations may understandably be the last thing on your mind. But we must ask for your support, which is needed in a new and urgent way.

We promise we will kick into an even higher gear to give you truthful news that cuts against the disinformation and vitriol and hate and violence. We promise to publish analyses that will serve the needs of the movements we all rely on to survive the next four years, and even build for the future. We promise to be responsive, to recognize you as members of our community with a vital stake and voice in this work.

Please dig deep if you can. A donation of any amount will be a truly meaningful and tangible action in this cataclysmic historical moment.



We’re with you. Let’s do all we can to move forward together.

With love, rage, and solidarity,
Maya, Negin, Saima, and Ziggy",[0]

92,"🚨We need to talk about the CCCP.

No, I’m not talking about the Soviet Union– I’m talking about the so-called “Commonwealth Conservative Coalition PAC.” Despite its deceptive name, it’s actually a coalition of RINO swamp rats who are running campaign ads against the most conservative legislators in the General Assembly.

This is the first time I have ever used the word “RINO” in public parlance, and I am hopeful that readers will understand the gravity of the situation. It disgusts me that the PAC was named “Commonwealth Conservative Coalition”, but it’s clear to me exactly why they did it. They knew they couldn’t attack authentic conservatives with a progressive-sounding name—it’s a blatant attempt to fool you. They assume that republican voters are stupid and easily tricked, so write this name down and don’t forget it.

This group is flush with the dark money that you hear about on TV. It’s real, and it’s being spent here in the Commonwealth. Who is contributing to this group?

•The radical left Louisville teacher’s union ($200k)
•The Kentucky Hospital Association ($50k)
•Churchill Downs ($200k)
•Out-of-State corporations such as Carvana, AirBnB, and others ($45k)

So why is the Louisville Teacher’s Union that spent hundreds of thousands of dollars re-electing Andy Beshear and pushing to allow boys to compete in girl’s sports…playing in Republican primaries?

Because they want to elect democrats who are masquerading as republicans; nanny state progressives who will do their tax-and-spend bidding! They know they need to trick authentic republican voters to accomplish that. These same hypocrites and the candidates they support despise Donald Trump, yet they run campaign ads featuring him because they think you’ll be dumb enough to fall for it.

With all of that said, these ads aren’t being targeted against me- so why do I care? I care because I don’t want you to be fooled, Kentucky. Regardless of which candidate you support in a primary, I implore you to do your research and not rely on what the Frankfort Deep State pays big money to tell you. Don’t relinquish your sacred vote to uniparty hacks who have no shame in teaming up with liberal democrats just to gain power.

We have a supermajority in the General Assembly, and we have a majority of registered republican voters, but what good does it do if we are not actively fighting for the principles of limited government and electing representatives who will do the same?

Folks, this is uncharted territory. Democrats have lost virtually all power in Frankfort with a veto-proof republican supermajority. Instead of trying to win back seats on the Democrat platform, they have joined hands with liberal republicans to defeat real conservatives.

Choose wisely on May 21st, and don’t be fooled by Limousine Liberals and RINOs who are working together to silence true conservatives! 🇺🇸",[10]

Because this is the problem you see all the dollar signs on this message. Trump is a multi billionaire and this is the problem with people that are rich people see opportunity if you accuse somebody of something and it’s reported everybody automatically believes it’s true. This is the same exact thing they did to Michael Jackson, but yet never found anything showing  He was guilty of anything, but they ruined him because he was trying to protect his name and he was pretty much bankrupt when he died because the mainstream media reports crap because the Democrat party is in control of what they want printed and said, and if you don’t go along with the program, this is what they do to you and being a billionaire. I just don’t see a billionaire going around and raping people and along with all these other bogus charges ,   considering  what he could lose. He has a lot more to lose  than they do and you have people out here that are always looking for opportunities and a lot of this is just plain common sense, but like there is 1 million ways to look at something and a lot of times you just have to make up your own mind what’s right in your heart. And the main reason I support Donald Trump is because I don’t believe we should have open borders. I don’t feel we should have all these illegals coming in and now give them free housing and medical for the taxpayers to pay for, I don’t like people being murdered and raped by all these individuals daily, I don’t believe in defunding the police. I think we need more police and we need to give them whatever’s needed to do their jobs and keep us safe. I don’t believe kids should be able to have sex change operations and their parents have no say over it and that’s what Harris supports. Tim Walz is OK with putting tampons in boys restrooms and locker rooms which is disgusting not even mentioning all the other stuff he’s lied about how his wife got pregnant his military background we can’t have someone running the country that can’t even be honest about stuff is simple as . I don’t believe that guys that change himself into a  women should be playing in women’s sports and I’m tired of paying almost 5 dollars a gallon for gas and where you used to go to the store and spend $100 on grocery is now costing me 300 and this list can go on and on .

97,"the Sad Reality of These Days

My previous post elicited a response I didn't expect. I had made that post out of a comment I had made on another's post. I thought it was an interesting bit of writing that crept out of me. Primarily I was intrigued with how I transitioned from history to present-day speculation and back to history.

It was not a piece of propaganda, as many accused me in the comment section. Specifically, it was not a piece of Democratic propaganda. So far as I am aware, I am not a member of any party and I most certainly do not work for any party.

I remember very distinctly a conversation I had with a close relation in 2015. I told her, ""When it comes to our current politics of Conservative and Liberal, Republican and Democrat - if we keep cheering on the wedge being driven between ourselves and our neighbors - I fear what will happen if that is continued.""

That conversation is almost ten years in my past and I find myself in the sad reality of these days. What I have to say, if I learned anything from my previous post, is that both sides fear the election of one or the other. The MAGA crowd made clear they believe Democrats are pursuing a Nazi-like agenda. Or at least, the many bots that twigged to the algorithm and filled my comment section with insensate rage and hate seemed to think that.

If many of those people turned out to be people and not a bunch of bots - all I can say is, ""Sorry brother or sister, but I can do nothing for you. I grieve you are so filled with hate and rage. That is a truly terrible place to be.""

I don't know. After a while I saw it as fruitless to keep reading through the comments. It was ultimately the same message - somehow Democrats are the real Nazis and MAGA is coming to save the day. Which is an interesting take because the Democrats have been mostly a group of craven cowards these past twenty or so years, in my honest opinion.

What I was interested in was my question of what role denial plays in our actions. What I have learned is that ultimately denial comes from fear. Fear of seeing an unpleasant truth in yourself, in someone close, in the people around you. I have seen people run into the arms of death because they couldn't face the truth they were presented with.

The only faith I truly believe in is in our capacity to see beyond that which is presented and to see the ultimate connection we all have to one another. It comes not from politics or profession, nor faith or spiritual alignment - it comes from the simple fact that we are human and inside each of us is a spark of the Divine. When we devalue and dehumanize others, we are ultimately showing our hate and rage to God who placed that spark in us. I believe fairly confidently that that was a primary message from Jesus. No doubt, there will be people who take exception to that statement. But ok.

I choose to believe that we are greater than hate and rage. I believe that if we step out of our petty day to day politics, we are able to see down the road. The question which is presented is - ""What future do we want to build for our children and their children on down the line?""

As it stands now we are presented a stark choice in this election. I believe Trump when he says he will pursue vengeance if he wins. I believe Biden when he says he will continue pursuing Bidenomics.

What I see are two very old rich white men who probably are too feeble to be in the Presidency. Both are locked in to their mindsets and we the citizenry are left to, once again, choose between these limited choices.

Here is what I think - if Trump is elected, we will suffer greatly as a country. For a simple reason - a lot of us knew he was a criminal going into the 2016 election. How much of a criminal we didn't fully know. Life long criminals, in my experience as a social worker, very strongly tend to be personality disordered people who do not have the capacity to care about anyone but themselves. From my perspective, that's all I've seen of Trump.

Now, if Biden is elected, we will have a hard time because we will have to confront uncomfortable truths about our democracy. We will have to see the parties for what they are and how neither of them truly represents the majority in this country. But the key issue is that - we will have the ability to do that self reflection.

I believe we are at a period of historical inflection. What we decide in the coming months will have impacts and outcomes no one can predict. That is why speculative fiction is speculative - you can only speculate as to what will happen. No one actually knows until it happens.

With that, by all means visit my page and most specifically the links to my books on Amazon. the Unity is my first novel - a rollicking space opera populated with characters you can't help but to love or hate. the Logistics Officer is my second novel on the life of Lieutenant Colonel Lawerence Beaucephus Stegall and his life of service.

100,"THIS IS A BATTLE FOR AMERICA’S BRAIN AS MUCH AS ITS HEART AND SOUL
We don’t want to live in a country where people can just make shit up. You can’t have competence or good values as a society if people don’t deal in truth and facts.

Beyond how maddening it is to have to negotiate daily life and the shape of society with people who believe whatever the hell suits them, it’s a fatal problem for the mechanics of civilization. It quickly becomes a competence issue, which in turn becomes a competitiveness problem – how far can you get in a world where everyone else is working with reality and you’re denying basic facts about climate change (for example)? What does politicizing the reality of it do to your response? It makes you DUMB. It forces you into stupid choices to validate the bullshit position you’re using politically.

For the last several decades, Republicans have been organizing their “reality” around the idea that the rest of us are wicked, un-American idiots who sponge off of them but look down on them. It’s not reality. It’s a made-up story, a dark fairy tale constructed to create a siege mentality that is useful politically for Republicans, but corrosive for society. It’s not hard to see what it produces: No matter what happens, Republicans simply cannot admit that their core story about the rest of society is bullshit. Whatever the rest of us are for HAS TO BE BAD. What a hopeless basis for making smart decisions as a society.

To take one example: In energy policy, Obama and Biden both pursued an “all of the above” approach that embraced fracking for geopolitical and economic reasons while also aggressively investing in the fossil-free future that’s coming whether we prepare for it or not. You can take issue with it environmentally, for sure, but it’s a politically defensible policy that takes account of present and future realities. Beyond messaging, there’s nothing ideological about it – it pisses off both environmentalists and oil tycoons while enabling both to prosper.

But what do Republicans say about it? They just lie that it’s green extremism that destroys American industry and scare-monger with lies about everyone being forced to buy electric cars and similar bullcrap.

Farmers and plenty of other Republicans know climate change is real and that pollution isn’t good for people – but under Trump, Republicans have to parrot the foolishness of going all-in on coal (of all the stupid things) and other fossil fuels and actively rolling back investments and regulations that prepare for the future.

Why? Because Trump lies that wind turbines and solar power are killing the economy, massacring birds, irritating whales and giving people windmill-noise cancer. Because he lies that we were only energy-independent under him when in fact we also were already under Obama and oil and gas production are HIGHER under Biden than under Trump. And when Trump says it, the lies have to be true for all the people who have invested in the lies. The results are STUPID.

Trump is both a beneficiary and a massive driver of this. His rise to the presidency would never have been possible without the preceding decades of turning society into a reality-neutralizing battlefield, but he has made things much worse because he is less knowledgeable and more of a liar than previous leaders.

This means that people are CONSTANTLY constructing “reality” around his incessant lies (instead of strategically around selected lies, as is normal in politics) and that the lies themselves are more inescapable and dumber than ever. The result is a political fantasy landscape dominated by loudmouth liars and crackpots, and where any kind of competence has to be rooted out and discredited because the hare-brained lies can’t withstand any scrutiny at all.

This rot corrodes the clarity and competence of society as a whole. We need to get rid of Trump and his lies because they create a false reality and result in stupidity and incompetence. I don’t care where you stand ideologically – a country can’t succeed when it is organized around bullshit and validating incompetence. And it can’t be a decent place either because there’s no accountability when people don’t agree on what’s real. The lying is unsustainable for society.

This needs to be a country and a world where it matters whether or not you’re acting in good faith. Our competence and our decency both depend on it. And just look at how both have nosedived since he came around. Who the hell wants this shit?",[0]

What scares me is that there were many, many Germans who saw what was happening as Hitler and the Nazis fought for power. They either spoke out or fled. But a significant minority (the Nazis) was committed to gaining power and the majority kept seeking reassurance that the fear was hysteria. And the only way it ended was Germany in ruins, partioned and governed by the nations who were forced to wage war in self defense by which time the Germans finally had to face the reality of what their decisions and acquiescence had led to.

That is what sends cold shivers of terror through my spine - the knowledge that we humans can’t face reality until we are forced to. Until then we are satisfied with the lies and obfuscations because those are more comfortable than the truth.

If Trump wins, the first thing that’ll happen are the arrests of opposition leadership and senior civil service. The majority will feel uncomfortable but will stay quiet because “they’re only getting arrested because they committed a crime.” That attitude and belief has become ingrained in us after 50 years of the carceral state operating on greater and greater budgets. People being arrested and imprisoned over bullshit is just an accepted practice.

When they begin operating an active political police force, people will see their neighbors carted off and will think, “better them than me.” They will justify those acts by saying to themselves, “well, I never really liked that asshole and it’s about time he/she got busted for it.”

Then they’ll realize they have to show pride and enthusiasm and every household will fly the MAGA flag.

When the teachers start teaching our kids the propaganda we’ll have the same problem as the Germans - the sudden fear of parents that their kids will turn them in because those kids will be taught to venerate Trump and MAGA above all else.

And that is the precise moment the majority of Germans realized how fucked they were. And that was when the midnight arrests and disappearances began and they all suddenly realized that any of them could disappear in a heartbeat for anything.

And thus does the state become father, mother, protector and persecutor and the only chance of safety is total abasement before the party and leadership.

And that’s the root of my fear - the understanding that the majority of us go through life in denial of the facts presented. I’ve always considered it the supreme superpower we have. To stand before reality and say, “I refuse to believe because it does not make me feel good.”

I’ve watched countless people walk themselves into prison, lose their children and destroy their lives because they can’t let go of their denial in the face of their reality. They’d rather believe the lie and have their children taken from them forever then to face the reality and have a shot at putting their family back together.

Because overcoming the denial requires our other great superpower - faith in ourselves.

It happened in our own backyard and we are finally waking up.<br> It was believed by our political leaders and the general population that once the Berlin Wall fell it was over. Nothing could be further from the truth.<br> The seeds germinated decade after decade while everyone was distracted buying popcorn, watching sports and fighting the wrong wars.<br> The booster to the process is of course immigration, stuffing the USA with people holding the wrong mentality and coming from government controlled countries. It was part of the process akin to the marxists and anarchists escaping Europe to South America where they slowly took over education, press and unions, sounds familiar?.<br> A similar mentality is applied to the political reality in America, a two party system, a society blinded to just seeing whatever the masters want to show you.<br> Arizona didn\xe2\x80\x99t escape this reality, while California, Florida, Oklahoma, New Jersey, Kentucky, Kansas and Louisiana\xe2\x80\x99s  Republican Parties have a positive growth, Arizona is negative by 53,812 compared to 2020, an astronomical growth of Independents show people are walking away from the Party bullcrap.<br> Let\'s talk about those fighting for real freedom inside the Arizona GOP, their cyclopic vision allows them to see just one road, whereby we are told to \xe2\x80\x9cvote whoever the manipulated primaries put in front of us.\xe2\x80\x9d You don\'t need to listen to my opinion, you just need to look back 2 years ago. The AZ GOP lost the Governor Seat, the AG Seat, the Secretary of State seat, and the Senate Seat. Do you think those seats were lost because the Democrats are doing better than the Republicans in AZ? The answer is NO! Democrats were showing worse numbers in the voter registration rolls than Republicans.<br> The reason resides inside the AZ GOP, and not in the core populist activist knocking on  doors, or the poor chairman that is running a county party with no money. The ones picking candidates are anonymous to the Precinct Committeeman or even to the Counties leadership and when their picked candidate doesn\'t win they pull their support from the nominee. It\xe2\x80\x99s happened over and over again for the last 20 years, but you being a conservative voter are still swimming in their illusion and you vote for their candidates when they win, and sadly they win 90% of the time.<br> Congressional District 6 in Arizona is proof of this. They can align their money and efforts behind an anonymous candidate and at the end you will fall for that.<br> What are the achievements that Juan Ciscomani has to represent the people of CD6?Business person? An activist? Running several times and having name recognition?Maybe a reporter? A Pastor or social worker? It is readily apparent that it is none of those things. Juan Ciscomani was just Duceys errand boy in Phoenix running errands with the ""border guys\xe2\x80\x9d. In the 2024 primaries Ciscomani was was able to pull a six digit figure to get Trump\'s endorsement even though he hates Trump! Let us not forget that Ciscomani was a McCain boy, just to make you believe he was MAGA enough to get your vote in the primaries. How can a guy with no achievements align powerful super pacs behind him as a junior seat in the appropriation committee in Congress? He didn\xe2\x80\x99t!, He was just picked because as a good bureaucrat, he is a servant of big interest and is willing to use his seat to pass any pork to benefit that big money group behind him. The reality is that Ciscomani hides behind shiny suits with an absence of intelligence, unable to articulate ideas or even debate. He hides. He is absent. He calls himself a Christian but can\'t articulate his position concerning abortion. He gets money from Jewish groups but he can\xe2\x80\x99t take a stand for Israel. He tells you he is for border security but has not voted for one dollar for the border. As McCain was, Ciscomani doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fall far from the tree, stuffing the budget and burying your money in wars.<br> Maybe his position at the Arizona/Mexico trade commission was key to him selling his soul to the corrupt machine running Arizona for decades. What commodities does Arizona trade other than drugs and humans with Mexico? Mainly produce. Surprisingly the produce, milk and even meat at the other side of the border are controlled by cartels, The Mayo Zambada, Sinaloa Cartel Empire. Some of the tomatoes and green peppers and the Sukarne beef sold in supermarkets in Arizona are basically making the cartel richer, so the ones trafficking humans and drugs also legally trade produce, milk and meats, maybe there resides the truth behind the blurred Ciscomani power.</span>",[10]

118,"WOMEN HAVE MORE POWER THAN THEY REALIZE
How could any woman think that voting for an openly sexist, racist man is a good idea? Why do people vote against their own self-interest? It’s easy to take the approach of “those women are uneducated and just don’t know better.” But the issue is more complex than that.

When men are assertive or opinionated, they are often praised, but when women act the same, they have “attitude problems” or are “trying too hard due to lack of confidence.” In short: Whatever a man perceives as threatening, he can mock and dismiss as being the woman’s problem – and get away with it.

One could brush it off and say that we (for the most part) live in an equal society. You could argue that “that’s just how things are, there is nothing you can do about it.” But what if the real power to finally get true equality is in how women look at themselves? This is the superpower that (too many) men are most afraid of and try to suppress or deflect from at whatever cost – and so far, to a great extent, they’ve succeeded.

Women have the power to relegate these attitudes to the dustbin of history where they belong.

119,Former President Donald Trump Found GUILTY in New York Felony Trial,[29]
120,"A repost - for a friend struggling after the debate:

My grandfather Charlie was not a sophisticated man. When he bought a car—always the same car, a blue Peugeot 305, replaced every few years with a newer model of the same exact make—he kept the seats covered in plastic to keep them eternally clean. When you asked him for an apple, he’d hold the fruit in his hand and rotate it like a tiny globe, peeling it with his pocketknife and making sure to remove only the skin and none of the flesh. When I ran away, as a child of 6 or 7, to explore a park nearby, he dashed out the door, wearing nothing but his underwear, and ran until he found me and hugged me tight. He didn’t even hear the passersby who pointed and laughed. Nothing mattered to him but his family.

He died when I was very young, so I know his life’s story only as a broad outline: Educated in a conservatory in Vienna, he was a promising young cellist and composer when he was spooked by the goosesteps of Hitler’s goons. He convinced two of his sisters to trade in a continental future for one less tender on the shores of Boston. Some of his friends, maybe even members of his family, pointed and laughed then, too, telling him he was hysterical, that he was getting it all wrong, that it couldn’t possibly be that bad. But grandpa Charlie wouldn’t listen: his simple heart advised him to take the thugs at their word and leave.

At least that’s how I imagine it—he never spoke of those early days, and his family and friends across Europe were all soon seized, deported, and murdered. I’m not sharing this particular story at this particular point in time to make some kind of historical analogy. Those are rarely useful even under the best of circumstances, and to compare Donald Trump to the Fuhrer or his ascent to the rise of the Third Reich is an absurd and reprehensible proposition. But I’ve been thinking a lot about my grandfather’s story this past week, and in it I find three simple commandments I can’t bring myself to dismiss.

The first, and most obvious, is this: treat every poisoned word as a promise. When a bigoted blusterer tells you he intends to force members of a religious minority to register with the authorities—much like those friends and family of Charlie's who stayed behind were forced to do before their horizon grew darker—believe him. Don’t try to be clever. Don’t lean on political intricacies or legislative minutia or historical precedents for comfort. Don’t write it off as propaganda, or explain it away as just an empty proclamation meant simply to pave the path to power. Take the haters at their word, and assume the worst is imminent.

Do that, and a second principle follows closely: You should treat people like adults, which means respecting them enough to demand that they understand the consequences of their actions. Explaining away or excusing the actions of others isn’t your job. Vienna in the first decades of the 20th century was a city inflamed with a desire to better understand the motives, hidden or otherwise, that move people to action. Freud and Kafka, Elias Canetti and Karl Kraus, Stefan Zweig and Franz Werfel—these were the eminences who crowded the same cafés Charlie and his musician friends most likely frequented. But while these beautiful minds struggled to understand the world around them, the world around them was consumed by simpler and more vicious appetites. Don’t waste any time, then, trying to understand: then as now, many were amused by the demagogue and moved by his vile vision. Some have perfectly reasonable explanations for their decisions, while others have little to go on but incoherent rage. It doesn’t matter. Voters are all adults, and all have made their choices, and it is now you who must brace for impact.

Whether you choose to forgive those, friends and strangers alike, who cast their votes so deplorably is a matter of personal choice, and none but the most imperious among us would advocate a categorical rejection of millions based on their electoral actions, no matter how irresponsible and dim. So while you make these personal calculations, remember that what matters now isn’t analysis: It’s survival.

Which leads me to the third principle, the one hardest to grasp: refuse to accept what’s going on as the new normal. Not now, not ever. In the months and years to come, decisions will be made that may strike you as perfectly sound, appointments announced that are inspired, and policies enacted you may even like. Friends and pundits will reach out to you and, invoking nuance, urge you to admit that there’s really nothing to fear, that things are more complex, that nothing is ever black or white. It’s a perfectly sound argument, of course, but it’s also dead wrong: This isn’t about policy or appointments or even about outcomes. This isn’t a political contest—it’s a moral crisis. When an inexperienced, thin-skinned demagogue rides into office by explaining away immensely complex problems while arguing that our national glory demands we strip millions of their dignity or their rights, our only duty is to resist by whatever means permitted us by law. The demagogue may boost the economy, sign beneficial treaties, and mend our ailing institutions, but his success can never be ours. Our greatness, to use a tired but true phrase, depends on our goodness, and to succeed, we must demand that our commander in chief come as close as is possible to reflecting the light of that goodness. There’s no point indulging in the kind of needlessly complex thinking that so often plagues the intelligent and the well-informed. There’s no room for reading tea leaves, for calculations or projections or clever takes. The only thing that matters now is the simple moral truth: This isn’t right. As long as we never forget that, we can never lose: As grandpa Charlie knew all too well, those who refuse to gradually put up with the darkness are making a very safe bet; if you’re wrong, there’s no harm, but if you’re right, you win more or less everything.

So forgive me if these next four years if I’m not inclined to be smart. When it comes to the task ahead, I’ve no interest in deep dives or shades of grey or mea culpas. Like my grandfather, I’m a simple Jew, and like him, I take danger at face value. When the levers of power are seized by the small hands of hateful men, you work hard, you stand with those who are most vulnerable, and you don’t give up until it’s morning again.",[0]

122,"VOTING FOR TRUMP IS LIKE GETTING RICH BY RAIDING YOUR SAVINGS ACCOUNT
All the bleary-eyed nostalgia for Trump is based on one-off handouts that invested nothing in the future and in fact compromised our ability to prepare for the future. His debt-funded tax cuts that went mostly to the rich, the stimulus checks appropriated by congress that he grubbily put his name on (also issued by Biden, but without Biden taking credit for a shared effort), and even his beloved wall was paid for – not by Mexico, of course – with money from the military budget. The phony bastard didn’t do one thing other than shift money from one place to another – mainly to rich people, for the benefit of Trump himself.

Would you feel better off if you drained your kids’ college funds? Because that’s what Trump did to create his fake image as a brilliant creator of wealth and prosperity. Oh sure, it works like a dream … if you ignore what it will cost you later.

Trump probably doesn’t even get it – for his whole life, it has paid off for him to take the loot now and then take the loot again later, never realizing that he could only take the loot again and again because other people were maintaining the infrastructure that enabled the loot to be created. His business model is parasitic.

But ordinary people should be wiser, because we can mess up our future if we don’t prepare for it. We have to squirrel away our provisions for the future and make wise choices, because unlike Donald Trump, we didn’t start with massive inheritances that allow us to buy our way back into the game every time we go bankrupt like he did.

We need people running the country who understand that humdrum reality and who will prepare the country for sustained prosperity by investing in the things we will need tomorrow to compete and succeed – not Trump’s foolish mindset of living off the profits, which only works if other people are putting in the work. Who’s working if Trump is at the top, handing out the spoils? Pay no mind to the pitiful Wizard of Trump behind the curtain …

Trump’s promised-but-never-delivered “infrastructure week” sums up the choice. Biden delivered massive infrastructure investment that will pay dividends for decades – Trump gave a tax cut that mostly went to the rich. Do the math and choose wisely.",[0]
123,"TRUMP-VOTERS: DON’T FOOL YOURSELVES ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF RE-ELECTING HIM. THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT RUNS OUT WHEN A CHOICE IS CONFIRMED
That goes for personal relationships and it goes for the way the US is seen by people around the world. You Trump-voters have been on a 10-year journey to reconcile yourselves with violating your own standards for personal gain. And you have a lot of fellow travelers on the same train to make you feel validated in your choice. It’s easy for many of you to ignore or dismiss how your journey is viewed by the people who aren’t on it with you. But the rest of us have not spent 10 years trying to rationalize Trump. We’ve been looking on with the same disgust we felt for him all along, and for the spectacle of watching you talk yourselves into a Faustian bargain by demonizing all the rest of us.

Trump’s loss in 2020 meant that all of us could let bygones be bygones for the sake of getting along with loved ones and other people in our lives. But then you let the scumbag back in. And if you vote for him again after all the shit he did in office, after trying to overturn the 2020 election and after all the repulsive shit he’s said and done since then, the message received by everyone outside of your self-deluding bubble is going to be a thousand times worse than it was in 2016 or even 2020. It will be a confirmation.

This is not a threat – it’s the weary foresight of knowing how it feels to see people make an “eff-you” choice in full knowledge of the consequences for others. Like watching a loved one return to a relationship-harming habit, listening to their rationalizations for indulging themselves again … It’s one thing to make a mistake. It’s quite another to ratify it again later.

That’s a personal angle, but the same thing goes for the view of the US around the world. People across the world shook their heads in 2016 and looked on with dismay and disbelief as Trump destabilized every institution of world affairs and raised doubts about US commitments in a way that no president had done in living memory, all while acting like a brash ignoramus who didn’t care what anyone thought. When Biden was elected in 2020, the world could interpret 2016 as a hair-raising fluke and see Biden’s recommitment to the institutions the US anchors as a reaffirmation of the stability of the US itself and as a reliable actor in the world.

Re-electing Trump will be a permanent knockout blow for the belief of people and countries around the world that they know what the US stands for. That is just a fact. Trump repudiated the US-established, rule-based world order in favor of bi-lateral power relations. That plainly overthrows what the world previously expected of the US, and confirming it will turn the chaotic exception into the new rule.

And he demonstrated something even more destructive – that the rule of law doesn’t even apply domestically under Trump. He views himself as a king and will lay waste to our system of government if that’s what it takes to enact his will and launder his crimes. He has already done so.

What does it mean for the world to see a USA that not only disregards its own rules on the international stage – which it has always done selectively, while still maintaining the rule-based order in general – but now doesn’t even apply the rule of law internally? Trump willingly conceded to all the Putins and Xis and Kims of the world, who say that the US is just a hypocrite that talks about laws and human rights only out of self-interest, that they were right all along. He puffed out his chest and boasted of it – you think we’re such angels?

No, we were never angels, but we had laws. It was not just a show – the rule of law matters to us. “We the people” … actually believe that our constitution gives us rights and protections that no one has the right to take away. It’s the whole fucking idea.

Trump destroys that by telling all of us, everywhere in the world, that our rights and protections depend only on our proximity to power. It’s the antithesis of everything the US has ever claimed to represent.

His first term was a wake-up call, to Americans and to the rest of the world. This could happen. You could wake up one day and suddenly find that the biggest country that claims to stand for the rule of law and for human rights (never mind its shortcomings – it remained a work in progress) and stands as a bulwark against authoritarianism … is itself now a scofflaw that gives succor to dictators and strikes fear into the hearts of ALLIES.

This, Trump-voters, is what your vote to re-elect him will mean to the rest of us who don’t live in your alternate reality of self-serving bullshit. That you are A-OK with that litany of destruction and all of his promises to treat other people like “vermin” as long as you think the lifetime scam artist is going to deliver for you.

There’s no mulligan this time. If you don’t know better now, it’s because you don’t want to. There are no excuses left for you. There’s no going back when you’ve watched the shit play out over 10 years and heard the appeals of the people around you and decided you didn’t care. It’s a message that we will take to heart whether we want to or not, because it’s going to cost us and you didn’t give a damn.",[0]

My previous post elicited a response I didn't expect. I had made that post out of a comment I had made on another's post. I thought it was an interesting bit of writing that crept out of me. Primarily I was intrigued with how I transitioned from history to present-day speculation and back to history.

It was not a piece of propaganda, as many accused me in the comment section. Specifically, it was not a piece of Democratic propaganda. So far as I am aware, I am not a member of any party and I most certainly do not work for any party.

I remember very distinctly a conversation I had with a close relation in 2015. I told her, ""When it comes to our current politics of Conservative and Liberal, Republican and Democrat - if we keep cheering on the wedge being driven between ourselves and our neighbors - I fear what will happen if that is continued.""

That conversation is almost ten years in my past and I find myself in the sad reality of these days. What I have to say, if I learned anything from my previous post, is that both sides fear the election of one or the other. The MAGA crowd made clear they believe Democrats are pursuing a Nazi-like agenda. Or at least, the many bots that twigged to the algorithm and filled my comment section with insensate rage and hate seemed to think that.

If many of those people turned out to be people and not a bunch of bots - all I can say is, ""Sorry brother or sister, but I can do nothing for you. I grieve you are so filled with hate and rage. That is a truly terrible place to be.""

I don't know. After a while I saw it as fruitless to keep reading through the comments. It was ultimately the same message - somehow Democrats are the real Nazis and MAGA is coming to save the day. Which is an interesting take because the Democrats have been mostly a group of craven cowards these past twenty or so years, in my honest opinion.

What I was interested in was my question of what role denial plays in our actions. What I have learned is that ultimately denial comes from fear. Fear of seeing an unpleasant truth in yourself, in someone close, in the people around you. I have seen people run into the arms of death because they couldn't face the truth they were presented with.

The only faith I truly believe in is in our capacity to see beyond that which is presented and to see the ultimate connection we all have to one another. It comes not from politics or profession, nor faith or spiritual alignment - it comes from the simple fact that we are human and inside each of us is a spark of the Divine. When we devalue and dehumanize others, we are ultimately showing our hate and rage to God who placed that spark in us. I believe fairly confidently that that was a primary message from Jesus. No doubt, there will be people who take exception to that statement. But ok.

I choose to believe that we are greater than hate and rage. I believe that if we step out of our petty day to day politics, we are able to see down the road. The question which is presented is - ""What future do we want to build for our children and their children on down the line?""

As it stands now we are presented a stark choice in this election. I believe Trump when he says he will pursue vengeance if he wins. I believe Biden when he says he will continue pursuing Bidenomics.

What I see are two very old rich white men who probably are too feeble to be in the Presidency. Both are locked in to their mindsets and we the citizenry are left to, once again, choose between these limited choices.

Here is what I think - if Trump is elected, we will suffer greatly as a country. For a simple reason - a lot of us knew he was a criminal going into the 2016 election. How much of a criminal we didn't fully know. Life long criminals, in my experience as a social worker, very strongly tend to be personality disordered people who do not have the capacity to care about anyone but themselves. From my perspective, that's all I've seen of Trump.

Now, if Biden is elected, we will have a hard time because we will have to confront uncomfortable truths about our democracy. We will have to see the parties for what they are and how neither of them truly represents the majority in this country. But the key issue is that - we will have the ability to do that self reflection.

I believe we are at a period of historical inflection. What we decide in the coming months will have impacts and outcomes no one can predict. That is why speculative fiction is speculative - you can only speculate as to what will happen. No one actually knows until it happens.

With that, by all means visit my page and most specifically the links to my books on Amazon. the Unity is my first novel - a rollicking space opera populated with characters you can't help but to love or hate. the Logistics Officer is my second novel on the life of Lieutenant Colonel Lawerence Beaucephus Stegall and his life of service. I think you'll like it.",[0]
135,"TRUMP IS A PSYCHOLOGICAL PLAGUE ON THIS COUNTRY IN WAYS BOTH OBVIOUS AND SUBTLE
Trump has violently yanked all of us off our moorings. It is difficult to hold this fact in mind because nearly half the country has decided en masse to pretend that there’s no problem other than the apocalyptic bullshit they say about the rest of us as an explanation for their own sense of unease caused by Trump; and the media and even our own psychological pendulums want to feel like the place they’ve come to rest is home instead of some strange and unsettling place that it would be best to leave right now even though we’re weary. We have an urge to come to terms with our reality that often overrides our sense of a need to change things because it is impossible to sustain that urgency indefinitely when you have to get on with life in a thousand ways that are more acute.

We all know that Trump’s mean spirit has affected us. Even his own supporters acknowledge it, if only indirectly, when they say that they wish he’d tone down his rude speech or mockingly dismiss it – “mean Tweets, boo-hoo!” – as a superficial problem that shouldn’t be given undue weight. He has coarsened the rhetoric and hardened the tone of the whole society, with inevitable effects in how people feel about and deal with each other. The tone of the societal discourse affects us all emotionally and it forces all of us to make emotionally and even morally fraught decisions, because when someone is attacking you, inaction is at least as fateful a choice as taking action yourself.

As an aside, many people are keen to assign blame equally for this coarsening and will implore you to be kind and gentle yourself even if the other guys are attacking you. But what is the result of that meekness? You are then unilaterally taking the abuse yourself and ceding an advantage to the attacker rather than raising the cost of the attack for the attacker and either stopping them or incentivizing them to lay off. It is not at all obvious what the right thing is to do in this situation, and neither course is without negative consequences. (This is actually the mechanism by which Trumpian aggression works: It costs you something to resist it, so oftentimes you won’t and he will get his prize, because it doesn’t cost him a thing to be a shit.)

This is the kind of lose-lose situation that is created all the time in Trumpworld, turning everyday situations in which there is no need to have friction with people, even if you are diametrically opposed to them in some way that has nothing to do with the situation at hand, into situations where there is friction because Trump has forced people out of their corners and made them have to either defend themselves or choose to swallow an act of hostility and incur the price of it themselves to avoid conflict.

It’s a loss of the free-flowing, jostling-by form of interaction with society that allows you to engage without having to be in conflict with people about stuff that has nothing to do with the moment you’re in.

The loss of that is so profound, as we have seen on a large scale through covid, an event that forced many people to suddenly have to foreground and prioritize something that they could, throughout their lives before that, hold as a private belief or feeling without have to put it front and center in their lives.

All of a sudden there was no place to go for people who had a strong reaction to the situation for whatever reason. Regardless of what you think about the responses that were generated by this, the effect was very clear. When people are forced to plant their flag in the public sphere about things that are deeply important to them which they could previously hold privately if they wanted to, without repercussions, it changes the nature of people’s engagement with society and how they feel about other people. It ripples through their whole stance toward society and people, which naturally affects their politics as well, because it creates an imperative to side with whoever will liberate them on that particular front and to fight anyone who will continue to put them on the spot, or whose putting them on the spot was perceived as an unforgettable and character-defining betrayal.

I have no sympathy for the thinking of covid dissidents, but I can see the predicament they found themselves in.

Covid was a natural disaster. (Any human culpability that has been or may be found in relation to it did not affect the force-majeure nature of it in people’s lives.) And look at how powerfully it affected politics and national life even though there was no identified culprit. Culprits had to be found, so powerful was the emotion stoked by it.

How much more powerful is it when things that are deeply important to you are brought to the fore in the public sphere by people acting deliberately? It’s unbearable.

Trump does this on the explicit, in-your-face level, when he demonizes people and talks about them as animals or vermin or criminals in their very blood, and talks about fellow citizens as enemies who have to be disempowered or the nation will cease to exist. And he does it in countless subtler ways. The simplest way to describe it is that he never lets anything be. He challenges and unsettles everything. You can’t even be sure of the most established things with him. You can’t be sure that presidents aren’t going to do certain things. You can’t be sure that they can’t get away with it. You can’t even be sure that they will accept the result of an election. Never mind all the simple things in everyday life that he calls into question. What can you trust at all if you are on Trump’s naughty list?

This kind of thinking is mocked and dismissed by people who are in denial about the glaring realities of Trump’s own words and actions; they will demand that you prove that any particular thing is going to happen. But the damage is done by the uncertainty. The problem is that you can’t know that it WON’T happen. A deep-seated layer of security is gone and you can’t even put your finger on it because although the dam wasn’t entirely breached, you now will never trust it fully again even though you never worried about it ever before.

Then there is the interpersonal level, where the effect he has on the people who have gradually shifted along with him, and accepted more and more violations of the previous standards as the new normal, all the while insisting that they haven’t moved at all and the rest of the world has gone mad, has in turn affected all the rest of us by unsettling relationships and forcing people to reassess the relationship or proceed under new terms and conditions that are not acknowledged by the person who changed them.

It’s a psychological disruption on a society-wide scale. Worldwide, even.

Some people will say that the emergence of Trump is actually a symptom of precisely this sort of disruption in the lives of the people who support him. While this is superficially apt in the sense that many people did feel like their world was disrupted, the validity stops there because their sense was either entirely manufactured or not due to the scapegoat reasons that were presented for it.

For example, while de-industrialization, supply-side economics and other societal changes changed many people’s lives for the worse and people had understandable reasons to feel hurt and damaged by events, the liberal and foreign-born culprits presented by right-wing media had nothing to do with the harms done.

Similarly, the way that liberal America has been portrayed as villainous and looking-down on rural people or whatever the specific accusation is, has done much to create a sense of beleaguered victimhood that may explain why people were open to Trump, but doesn’t actually comport with reality.

The reality is that there was nothing stopping the now Trumpian part of the country from jostling by with the rest of us if they hadn’t brainwashed themselves into believing that we were victimizing them. All the stuff that is decried as changing their world doesn’t actually change it – no one has to gay-marry or be trans or even accept anything they don’t want to accept. They just can’t make it impossible for other people. There’s no inherent conflict there and no reason why the different worlds can’t jostle along with each other.

Trump destroys this “jostling along” form of society because he constantly forces people to take sides on everything. He constantly defines and demonizes enemies because leveraging conflict is the only way he knows how to wield power. He constantly forces people to define where they stand in relation to him, to say whether they support him or condone his abuses of power or not. He never just lets anyone be, because when people are left to their own devices, they eventually are appalled by some shitty thing he did. And he always escalates because that’s the only way to neutralize the qualms that arose over the last thing he did.

Trump is a dynamo that constantly swirls up all this shit and damage as a way of keeping himself going. It’s deeply damaging to society to have to constantly deal with the drama and anguish and the gaslighting that comes from all the people who are condoning and rationalizing yet another breach of the standards that they held themselves as recently as yesterday. It’s a never-ending kind of trauma that we will be forced to unspool and heal from for a long time after he and his ill effects are gone.

We can’t afford to keep taking this damage before we stop. This is far bigger than any question about policy, partly because it’s deeper and harder to resolve, but mainly because the damage it causes also defines what kind of policy is possible in a very negative way. It creates a situation in which everything seems to be extremely high-stakes, and becomes very high-stakes in reality because the heightened environment makes normal politics seem like an abdication of responsibility for the seriousness of the moment.

The Trump era has us all talking about and contemplating systemic changes that weren’t even in the realm of discussion for generations. Why? This is the escalation – the spiraling – that results naturally from a having a person like him in a place of so much power.

He is damaging to our political system and way of life. And he is ruining the society that undergirds it by removing the unseen but indispensable ability to live and let live, to jostle by, to accept and maybe even appreciate difference because it’s not forcing you to defend your existence every minute of the day. We can’t afford to keep taking this damage before we stop.

________________________________

p.s. It’s worth pointing out that Trump is just as much a source of the sense of disruption among his own supporters as he is for the rest of us. They don’t think so because they have convinced themselves that a range of scapegoats are responsible for changing their lives, even though most of their lives have not been changed by those liberal and foreign-born scapegoats at all. Trump himself is the chief external cause of psychological ructions in their lives. He is the one that brings constant contentiousness and a sense of precarity to their lives because he is the one telling them that they have to support his unsettling transgressions to save themselves from the horrors he relentlessly conjures up in his public remarks.

Bear that in mind when they say that Trump is going to save them from a threat that you know doesn’t exist at all or in the way they claim it does.",[0]

This election is going to come down to whatever randomly-selected handful of voters in 3-7 states make up the winning margin. If that’s 87 people in Pennsylvania, 14 in Wisconsin and 211 in Michigan, it doesn’t matter who the hell they are. It wasn’t the “undecided” ones who broke one way – it was EVERY SINGLE PERSON who broke that way. And it’s obviously pointless to talk to the weather-vane-brained nimrods who can’t decide between a normal person and a deranged hatemonger. I want to talk to the smart people out there who have a damn good reason to be pissed off at the very thought of Trump winning.

That mean-hearted bastard is going to rule like he has a mandate to be the eternal king even if he loses the popular vote by millions – just like he did in 2016. That fucker got 3 million less votes than Hillary and what did he do? He took away the constitutional right to an abortion that has been supported by 60-70% of the population for 50 years. He took away women’s autonomy and has been bragging about it ever since. He tried to bribe a foreign leader to produce dirt on his election opponent using funds appropriated by congress. He tried to overthrow the election he lost. He sat on his fat ass doing nothing for several hours while a mob he incited was chanting to hang Mike Pence and beating up police in the capitol. He treated our allies like shit and dictators like a love-sick groupie who wanted to be admired by the worst people in the world. He separated children from their families at the border, some of which have still not been reunited with their parents for fuck sake. He instituted a “Muslim ban” and he talked about people from Haiti and Africa as being from “shithole countries.”

What the hell do you think he means by shithole? He means that the people from there are shit, and that’s exactly what he thinks of the people who are already Americans whose ancestors were stolen from those places. The man talks constantly about “genes” and the blood of the country being “poisoned” by people who don’t have good genes. You want a fucking Nazi president? What kind of genes do you think he favors? Where do you think that’s headed?

The pig has been found by two juries to have raped a woman and he’s been credibly accused by tens of others of doing exactly what he personally bragged about doing on the Access Hollywood tape. “When you’re a celebrity they let you do it,” said the swine. He mocks disabled people. He was reported by a decorated general whom he personally selected to be his Chief of Staff of calling WWII dead “suckers.” He is a piece of shit from top to bottom and you have to be an absolute schmuck if you’re a woman, a minority or any other person who gives a shit about human rights and human dignity to vote for a man who has proven over his whole life that he has no respect for anyone but roguish White men who do and take whatever they want.

DO NOT VOTE FOR THAT FUCKER! YOU WILL REGRET IT! WE WILL ALL REGRET IT – even the dumbasses who think he’s on their team. The law and the constitution are there to PROTECT AGAINST a person like him, because if you get someone who will break the system to do what he wants, it doesn’t matter if you think he’s on your team or not. Sooner or later someone else will use the power he usurped to fuck you over and the safeguards that used to protect all of us will be gone.

This after 8 days of preparations & debate practice !
The only astonishing surprise of the night was that Jake Tapper & Dana Bash acted relatively neutral !
After the debate, his handlers & puppet masters said he had a sore throat & a cold, to lessen the effects & embarassment of his disastrous performance. No such mention anytime before the debate !
Jill Biden greeted him like a little child, saying something like “ well done Joe, you answered all the questions “ !

138,"TRUMP IS A PSYCHOLOGICAL PLAGUE ON THIS COUNTRY IN WAYS BOTH OBVIOUS AND SUBTLE
Trump has violently yanked all of us off our moorings. It is difficult to hold this fact in mind because nearly half the country has decided en masse to pretend that there’s no problem other than the apocalyptic bullshit they say about the rest of us as an explanation for their own sense of unease caused by Trump; and the media and even our own psychological pendulums want to feel like the place they’ve come to rest is home instead of some strange and unsettling place that it would be best to leave right now even though we’re weary. We have an urge to come to terms with our reality that often overrides our sense of a need to change things because it is impossible to sustain that urgency indefinitely when you have to get on with life in a thousand ways that are more acute.

We all know that Trump’s mean spirit has affected us. Even his own supporters acknowledge it, if only indirectly, when they say that they wish he’d tone down his rude speech or mockingly dismiss it – “mean Tweets, boo-hoo!” – as a superficial problem that shouldn’t be given undue weight. He has coarsened the rhetoric and hardened the tone of the whole society, with inevitable effects in how people feel about and deal with each other. The tone of the societal discourse affects us all emotionally and it forces all of us to make emotionally and even morally fraught decisions, because when someone is attacking you, inaction is at least as fateful a choice as taking action yourself.

As an aside, many people are keen to assign blame equally for this coarsening and will implore you to be kind and gentle yourself even if the other guys are attacking you. But what is the result of that meekness? You are then unilaterally taking the abuse yourself and ceding an advantage to the attacker rather than raising the cost of the attack for the attacker and either stopping them or incentivizing them to lay off. It is not at all obvious what the right thing is to do in this situation, and neither course is without negative consequences. (This is actually the mechanism by which Trumpian aggression works: It costs you something to resist it, so oftentimes you won’t and he will get his prize, because it doesn’t cost him a thing to be a shit.)

This is the kind of lose-lose situation that is created all the time in Trumpworld, turning everyday situations in which there is no need to have friction with people, even if you are diametrically opposed to them in some way that has nothing to do with the situation at hand, into situations where there is friction because Trump has forced people out of their corners and made them have to either defend themselves or choose to swallow an act of hostility and incur the price of it themselves to avoid conflict.

It’s a loss of the free-flowing, jostling-by form of interaction with society that allows you to engage without having to be in conflict with people about stuff that has nothing to do with the moment you’re in.

The loss of that is so profound, as we have seen on a large scale through covid, an event that forced many people to suddenly have to foreground and prioritize something that they could, throughout their lives before that, hold as a private belief or feeling without have to put it front and center in their lives.

All of a sudden there was no place to go for people who had a strong reaction to the situation for whatever reason. Regardless of what you think about the responses that were generated by this, the effect was very clear.

140,"ARE WE GOING TO GIVE OURSELVES A CHANCE TO WIN OR JUST WATCH THIS HAPPEN?
We got into the fight against Trump – in 2015 – because Trumpism is an attack on our shared reality that will destroy the rule of law, entrench injustices, spread hatred, lay the groundwork for wars and inflict cruelty on countless lives. His first term showed the outline of it and his second term would be an exponentially worse validation and implementation of everything evil about it. That stark reality demands two things of us as citizens: That we fight to defeat him at every juncture; and that we fight to defend reality. The only thing worse than losing this infernal election would be to lose it while also losing our grip on what makes us different than the tribal hallucinators whose collective decision to buy into a fake alternate reality has brought us to this brink.

We can’t beat Trumpism by becoming as tribal as them or by creating our own separate world of self-serving bullshit. We have to offer a sane, reality-based alternative to them. The fact that we acknowledge reality and spar over it with each other is *our strength* and the thing that distinguishes us from the orgy of lies and cynicism that they have become.

Don’t do it yourselves, and don’t ask us, to fight the Republicans’ collective delusion about Trump and society with an insistence on our side that we close ranks around some delusion of our own. I understand the motives of people who would put on the blinders to some extent for sake of a unity that feels so crucial in this situation, but that is the wrong path to winning and it is the wrong path to winning the longer battle against the insanity that they have imposed on our society.

We use the same eyes with which we view Trump to look at our own side of the fight. We *expect more* of the people on our side. We mean it when we say how much it matters, and we believe that everyone else does too. So we can’t look indulgently at Biden making the decision to name himself the quarterback of our team when he must have known that he can’t throw a 20-yard pass to save his life. That’s irresponsible. It’s a damn outrage, to be honest. We’ll give him the benefit of the doubt that he had more faith in his ability to win than he has demonstrated, but it’s no excuse for being willing to take the team down with him when the game situation is clear and the clock is ticking.

This is not just the case for staying true to ourselves and offering a real alternative to their cynical bullshit. It is also the case for winning. In 2020, Biden was the mirror opposite of Trump: Decent, competent, normal. But the course of world events, relentless Republican propaganda, Trump’s distorting influence and Biden’s unignorable aging process have nullified Biden’s 2020 political advantages over Trump. The insane reality is that many people don’t even think Biden is *more competent* than Trump. Stare at that line in disbelief … but it is true.

Even if you try to argue that the candidates are the same, although the consensus is that Biden has declined more than Trump (another insane premise, but electorally salient nonetheless), the situation is totally different. Whereas Biden in 2020 was the person who most comprehensively denied Trump any advantages, this time he is perhaps the only potential Democratic nominee who is not perceived as having *any* advantages over Trump other than the baseline that all of them have, which is better policies and manners.

After the debate gave Trump the upper hand in categories like mental acuity and debating that should be knockout disciplines for any sentient being facing Trump, Biden is the *worst* available option. Everyone else starts out with advantages over Trump in several other categories and the potential to build on that. What is Biden going to build on now? *He was losing before the debate.* How is he going to gain ground?

The best arguments for Biden at this point are the idea that his frailty could paradoxically focus people’s minds on the choice and make people think harder about how unfit Trump is; and the possibility that a handful of people who might have sat it out will rally to his side because they don’t like to see him pilloried in the public debate. Hope springs eternal, but are those the reeds we’re all supposed to cling to?

Contrast that with anyone else coming in and having an immediate bump into the margin of error and possibly the lead with a chance to sustain and build on it. Has anyone heard a better case for how we’re going to win with Biden? Any case at all? “It’s going to work somehow because it worked before (even though it wasn’t working before and just got worse)” and “it’s risky to change at this late stage” is not a game plan – it’s capitulation to fate. We have to give ourselves a chance to win. Snap out of the stupor, people!",[27]

142,"11/11 - VETERANS DAY ... an EPIC DATE IN HISTORY
Paid by Author not by Facebook

Just as 9/11 has become a date of remembrance of tragedy, 11/11 is a date to replace sadness with memorials of God’s provident care. As I stood at the wall in Washington DC reading the memorial to World War I, I was struck by the date and time of the Armistice which ended the so-called “Great War.” It read that the Armistice to end the war was signed on 11/11 1918 at exactly 11:00 AM. This combination of 11/11/11 caused me to wonder if the great mathematician and creator of the universe was speaking with precision and order using numbers and dates.
I found that 11/11 is a significant ... even epic date ... many times in history.

As with World War I, this date is often linked to an historic and transformational change in leadership. The end of World War 1 was, in fact of HIStory, the end of man’s attempt at empire. I submit that it was actually the fulfillment of a key prophecy from Daniel chapter 7 regarding the final four earthly empires which precede the everlasting Kingdom of God. WW1 ended the last remnants of the 4th and final earthly Roman Empire (Four wanna be empires all ended in defeat - Austria/Hungary, German, Russian Czar, and the last declared Jihad by the Ottoman Empire). Christian forces of Britain and the United States were the primary victors. Soon after, the vaunted British Empire lost its colonies to nationalist trends, leaving the USA as the remaining world power ... with no desire to colonize but evangelize. (our founding father's vision).

Both scripture and historical events reveal more than just random or coincidental events of significance surrounding the date of November 11. Amazingly, in the 11th book of the Bible, in the 11th Chapter and the 11th verse, God revealed His Kingdom plan to establish His chosen leaders, and remove those who no longer serve His purpose. This principle from scripture began with King Solomon, when he ignored the commands of God, and violated the leadership responsibilities to which he had been called;
11 Wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.

(1 Kings 11:11 - Book 11/Chapter 11/Verse 11)
As we honor our Veterans on this 11/11 date, we must include heroes from many generations, as God has advanced His Kingdom on Earth as it is in Heaven! This history is detailed in my book, ""The Last Seal of the King"". ()

143,"Dear Truthout Community,

If you feel rage, despondency, confusion and deep fear today, you are not alone. We’re feeling it too. We are heartsick. Facing down Trump’s fascist agenda, we are desperately worried about the most vulnerable people among us, including our loved ones and everyone in the Truthout community, and our minds are racing a million miles a minute to try to map out all that needs to be done.

We must give ourselves space to grieve and feel our fear, feel our rage, and keep in the forefront of our mind the stark truth that millions of real human lives are on the line. And simultaneously, we’ve got to get to work, take stock of our resources, and prepare to throw ourselves full force into the movement.

Journalism is a linchpin of that movement. Even as we are reeling, we’re shoring up all the energy we can to face down what’s coming, because we know that one of the sharpest weapons against fascism is publishing the truth.

There are many terrifying planks to the Trump agenda, and we plan to devote ourselves to reporting thoroughly on each one and, crucially, covering the movements resisting them. We also recognize that Trump is a dire threat to journalism itself, and that we must take this seriously from the outset.

Last week, the four of us sat down to have some hard but necessary conversations about Truthout if Trump were to win. How would we defend our publication from an avalanche of far right lawsuits that seek to bankrupt us? How would we keep our reporters safe if they need to cover outbreaks of political violence, or if they are targeted by authorities? How would we urgently produce the practical analysis, tools and movement coverage that you need right now -- breaking through our normal routines to meet a terrifying moment in ways that best serve you?

It will be a tough, scary four years to produce social justice-driven journalism. We need to deliver news, strategy, liberatory ideas, tools and movement-sparking solutions with a force like never before. And at the same time, we desperately need to protect our ability to do so.

We know this is such a painful moment and donations may understandably be the last thing on your mind. But we must ask for your support, which is needed in a new and urgent way.

We promise we will kick into an even higher gear to give you truthful news that cuts against the disinformation and vitriol and hate and violence. We promise to publish analyses that will serve the needs of the movements we all rely on to survive the next four years, and even build for the future. We promise to be responsive, to recognize you as members of our community with a vital stake and voice in this work.

Please dig deep if you can. A donation of any amount will be a truly meaningful and tangible action in this cataclysmic historical moment.



We’re with you. Let’s do all we can to move forward together.

With love, rage, and solidarity,
Maya, Negin, Saima, and Ziggy",[0]

146,"REPUBLICAN SHOOTS TRUMP

JOE BACKS OUT

KAMALA SURGES

I think it is easy to believe that when things are going your way, things will just continue apace. For the moment, all eyes are on Kamala and Walz, seeing their stardom glitter on the pollster's screen. It feels so good to finally feel good about a politician that all the attendant misery is forgotten.

And we probably need moments like this. For those days the magic feels distant, the rush of good feelings is hanging back, or we just feel lost and desperate for hope. We remember when it felt good and we remember why it felt good. We realize hope never dies.

Trump seems to have decided to embody the criticism he'd just been laying on Biden. He seems tired, he rambles incoherently at his public events, the Right Wing media seems to just be floundering, trying to figure out how MAGA suddenly lost the forward momentum. For many on the Left, and in the Center, and some on the Right - it seems simple to say Trump is done.

Maybe he is. Maybe all it really took to defang his nastiness was to put up the very personage he's spent his entire life hating - a Black Woman. His tender sensibilities must just be eating themselves alive in his head. I mean, its one thing to lose to another old, rich white man but to lose to a black woman? Oh, thank you Universe, this is the schadenfreude we need.

I am all for it. I am 100% in support of this ride.

So 2024 is headed to go down as one of the most critical moments in history. The hand off of power has begun and some are still committed to stopping that from happening. And it could, that's why I caution against giving in fully to the good feelings being generated. Trump is wounded at the moment but that won't last forever. He still has the violence card to play, he still has his potential allies for setting up conditions to steal power and that's why I advise caution.

A cornered animal is the most dangerous. It has nothing left to lose. What position do you think Trump is in?

In the meantime, by all means read one of my books! If you've got Kindle Unlimited they're free reads for you.",[29]
147,"ARE WE GOING TO GIVE OURSELVES A CHANCE TO WIN OR JUST WATCH THIS HAPPEN?
We got into the fight against Trump – in 2015 – because Trumpism is an attack on our shared reality that will destroy the rule of law, entrench injustices, spread hatred, lay the groundwork for wars and inflict cruelty on countless lives. His first term showed the outline of it and his second term would be an exponentially worse validation and implementation of everything evil about it. That stark reality demands two things of us as citizens: That we fight to defeat him at every juncture; and that we fight to defend reality. The only thing worse than losing this infernal election would be to lose it while also losing our grip on what makes us different than the tribal hallucinators whose collective decision to buy into a fake alternate reality has brought us to this brink.

We can’t beat Trumpism by becoming as tribal as them or by creating our own separate world of self-serving bullshit. We have to offer a sane, reality-based alternative to them. The fact that we acknowledge reality and spar over it with each other is *our strength* and the thing that distinguishes us from the orgy of lies and cynicism that they have become.

Don’t do it yourselves, and don’t ask us, to fight the Republicans’ collective delusion about Trump and society with an insistence on our side that we close ranks around some delusion of our own. I understand the motives of people who would put on the blinders to some extent for sake of a unity that feels so crucial in this situation, but that is the wrong path to winning and it is the wrong path to winning the longer battle against the insanity that they have imposed on our society.

We use the same eyes with which we view Trump to look at our own side of the fight. We *expect more* of the people on our side. We mean it when we say how much it matters, and we believe that everyone else does too. So we can’t look indulgently at Biden making the decision to name himself the quarterback of our team when he must have known that he can’t throw a 20-yard pass to save his life. That’s irresponsible. It’s a damn outrage, to be honest. We’ll give him the benefit of the doubt that he had more faith in his ability to win than he has demonstrated, but it’s no excuse for being willing to take the team down with him when the game situation is clear and the clock is ticking.

This is not just the case for staying true to ourselves and offering a real alternative to their cynical bullshit. It is also the case for winning. In 2020, Biden was the mirror opposite of Trump: Decent, competent, normal. But the course of world events, relentless Republican propaganda, Trump’s distorting influence and Biden’s unignorable aging process have nullified Biden’s 2020 political advantages over Trump. The insane reality is that many people don’t even think Biden is *more competent* than Trump. Stare at that line in disbelief … but it is true.

Even if you try to argue that the candidates are the same, although the consensus is that Biden has declined more than Trump (another insane premise, but electorally salient nonetheless), the situation is totally different. Whereas Biden in 2020 was the person who most comprehensively denied Trump any advantages, this time he is perhaps the only potential Democratic nominee who is not perceived as having *any* advantages over Trump other than the baseline that all of them have, which is better policies and manners.

After the debate gave Trump the upper hand in categories like mental acuity and debating that should be knockout disciplines for any sentient being facing Trump, Biden is the *worst* available option. Everyone else starts out with advantages over Trump in several other categories and the potential to build on that. What is Biden going to build on now? *He was losing before the debate.* How is he going to gain ground?

The best arguments for Biden at this point are the idea that his frailty could paradoxically focus people’s minds on the choice and make people think harder about how unfit Trump is; and the possibility that a handful of people who might have sat it out will rally to his side because they don’t like to see him pilloried in the public debate. Hope springs eternal, but are those the reeds we’re all supposed to cling to?

Contrast that with anyone else coming in and having an immediate bump into the margin of error and possibly the lead with a chance to sustain and build on it. Has anyone heard a better case for how we’re going to win with Biden? Any case at all? “It’s going to work somehow because it worked before (even though it wasn’t working before and just got worse)” and “it’s risky to change at this late stage” is not a game plan – it’s capitulation to fate. We have to give ourselves a chance to win. Snap out of the stupor, people!",[0]
148,"Tomorrow is election day. I know that in a political campaign, so much gets boiled down into 30-second ads and soundbites. So I wanted to write you a substantive note about my intentions as governor.

Missouri is a great state. We have so many advantages. First among them is the strength and courage of our people. We have done great things, and can do more.

Our greatest weakness, in my humble opinion, is our political class. On the left and right, they have let us down time and time again. It’s because they are consumed by group-think and big money that is totally divorced from the interests of the people. They campaign on one thing, and then do another. And we’re left frustrated and disappointed.

It doesn’t have to be this way. In states like Texas, Tennessee, and Florida people are making more money and enjoying the rewards of bold, conservative policies. When Texas and Florida put illegals on buses and shipped them to sanctuary cities, even some weak Republicans there said they were going too far. They held firm. Now, it’s obvious they did the right thing.

I’ve got a few simple promises that I’ve discussed in detail throughout this campaign. When I get elected we are going to:

End personal property tax so that you don’t have to pay rent to the government on things that you own. 29 other states have done this. So can we. It’s not hard to make up the difference.

Deport illegal immigrants living in our state by declaring an invasion under Article IV of the Missouri constitution. My opponent called it “foolish.” I think it’s foolish to let the chaos continue.

Secure our elections by returning to the common-sense standard of hand-counted ballots rather than untrustworthy machines. That’s obvious.

Of course, there’s more. Replace education bureaucracy with higher-paid teachers in the classroom. Get rid of waste like DEI government spending so we can focus on essential services. Eliminate the income tax. Ban foreign-ownership of Missouri land and return it to the people, because Missouri should enrich Missourians…or at least Americans.

I just want to live in a Missouri where the courage and instincts of our politicians match the boldness and intelligence of our people. The good news is: we’re close to making it happen. That's why Trump endorsed our campaign.

I’ll fill you in on what our data people are saying. Every model shows this is now a two-way race between our campaign–the conservative grassroots–and Mike Kehoe–the establishment pick. We are tied and surging, while voters are starting to learn about his opposition to deportation and quiet passion for tax hikes. They actually don’t like that stuff. If you’re a RINO, you can’t fool people with your big-money PACs forever. (Ashcroft is plummeting and, at this point, is a wasted vote.)

When we win on Tuesday, it will be thanks to an army of grassroots conservative Missourians who stood up and said “No More.” That will ring throughout the halls of our capitol, and they will realize that the people are more powerful than the liberal special interests that have captured that place for so long.

If you read all this, and you’re with that mission: I’m asking you to do one thing for me. Can you text or call ten of your friends–right now–and let them know how you’re voting tomorrow? If just 1,000 of our supporters do this–we cannot lose. It’s more powerful than any ad, mailer, or annoying mass text. In fact, it’s what all good campaigns should look like. The people, not PACs, decide elections. In a tied race like this one, it is very likely to make all the difference.","[10, 13]"

The phony bastard didn’t do one thing other than shift money from one place to another – mainly to rich people, for the benefit of Trump himself.

Would you feel better off if you drained your kids’ college funds? Because that’s what Trump did to create his fake image as a brilliant creator of wealth and prosperity. Oh sure, it works like a dream … if you ignore what it will cost you later.

Trump probably doesn’t even get it – for his whole life, it has paid off for him to take the loot now and then take the loot again later, never realizing that he could only take the loot again and again because other people were maintaining the infrastructure that enabled the loot to be created. His business model is parasitic.

But ordinary people should be wiser, because we can mess up our future if we don’t prepare for it. We have to squirrel away our provisions for the future and make wise choices, because unlike Donald Trump, we didn’t start with massive inheritances that allow us to buy our way back into the game every time we go bankrupt like he did.

As an American and supporter of democracy and our constitutional republic, I categorically reject everything Donald Trump stands for.

Women have died and will continue to die because of his position against abortion. Trump himself is a shady businessman who stiffed his contractors and walked into teenage beauty pageant dressing rooms. He is a rapist and a felon. There are marriages and families who are endangered by his reelection, people who live right here in the Heights community whose lives are in danger.

I stand for rights and equality for our black and brown brothers and sisters, our immigrant brothers and sisters, our LGBTQIA+ neighbors, and the religious and non-religious. Tolerance is a social contract of mutual respect among all groups. A vote for Donald Trump breaks that contract. And it puts people in danger.

It is time that the self-serving false front of a neutral nonpartisan Trump supporter and voter be called out for what it is: basic bullshit.

Trump is not ambiguous about how he feels or who he will allow close to the levers of power. Many will be lost, deported, marginalized, imprisoned, or killed in the process. So, if in spite of all that, if you feel called out for voting for him, you aligned yourself with Trump and his hate. You listened to his rhetoric, you walked into the voting booth, and you filled the circle next to his name. That is the choice you have to live with. If you stand by that vote, shame on you. And if you insist on doubling down on that vote with another round of inflammatory, defamatory, and absolutely false rhetoric to somehow justify your vote, that says far more about you than about anyone else.

160,"Trump Trial - what a waste of time and tax dollars but what do you expect when you elect partisan DAs these days?

By Attorney Jen GV
Gilliland Vanasdale

Former President Trump is in on trial in the state of New York for alleged campaign finance law. The crime apparently is that he paid $130, 000 “hush money” to stop a story involving an affair with Stormy Daniels. In doing so, the alleged crime is that he misclassified the payment as a legal expense and failed to report as a campaign expense as the payment was done to influence an election.

As such, the charge is that this payment violates campaign finance law. The federal government is not prosecuting this alleged crime but rather a Manhattan District Attorney who is elected in a partisan election filed charges.

Who is the victim? Apparently, the taxpayers and voters, yet there are no live coverage of the trial proceedings so the victims can see the evidence and the work of the partisan District Attorney who they elected. The irony of all of this is that the trial is held in hush. Why?

The star witness of the prosecution is a former attorney (Cohen) to Mr. Trump. As an attorney, I am appalled that a District Attorney would rely on an attorney who secretly recorded his client to testify. Attorney-client communications are privileged and Mr. Cohen secretly recorded his client.

This should never happen, and his testimony should not be permitted in my opinion. I can't think of anything more egregious than an attorney violating his or her client's expectation of confidentiality.

Another lawyer, who previously represented Ms. Daniels and who was known to represent many persons who made similar settlements with celebrities, was also a witness in this case. Since Mr. Trump was a candidate at that time of his settlement though, the District Attorney is claiming that the settlement basically needed to be reported as a campaign expenditure because making the payment and quashing the story was for political reasons to influence an election.

If this is the case, then I would think that this entire trial should be reported as a campaign expense to the Manhatten District Attorney and the Democratic party. No one with a straight face can say that this trial is anything but political and to try to influence the upcoming Presidential Election, at the expense of the alleged victims.

And I don’t say this to pick on Democrats, because I know Republicans are not immune from trying to prosecute political enemies. That’s why I tried to take on 5 term Republican incumbent Butler County District Attorney as an Independent. We got 42% of the vote, and that is nice, but it is still a loss. The greater loss though, in my opinion, is to the people.

Until we find a way to take politics out of electing District Attorneys and Judges, then it is the new norm. So, look for President Biden to be charged in 2025 and we can continue to waste time and tax dollars and having trials in secret so that District Attorneys and Judges can carry on the work for their political party without the people’s oversight. Because maybe if the people truly saw what was going on, we may actually vote for change one of these days.",[10]

This is the same exact thing they did to Michael Jackson, but yet never found anything showing  He was guilty of anything, but they ruined him because he was trying to protect his name and he was pretty much bankrupt when he died because the mainstream media reports crap because the Democrat party is in control of what they want printed and said, and if you don’t go along with the program, this is what they do to you and being a billionaire.

""Educational institutions are expending so many resources putting systems in place, training their employees, educating their student bodies, and then having to do it all over again in a short period of time when regulations change as much as they have in 2020 and now 2024."" ...



Hamill, who is based in Philadelphia, said it would be hard to know whether the current Department of Education is changing its strategy with pending litigation in light of the election results.

""Will they press forward in the time they have left, knowing that there still may be no rulings prior to the inauguration?"" Hamill questioned. ""Once in place, the Trump administration could always choose to abandon the department's appeals seeking to undo the injunctions.""

Hamill added that, once in office, Trump cannot simply sign an executive order undoing the 2024 regulations that were issued following a notice and comment period. Instead, that would require another lengthy rulemaking process to undo what Biden put in place.

""If the Trump administration were to promulgate new regulations that were not simply a carbon copy of the 2020 regulations, there may be some parts of the 2024 regulations that could survive,"" Hamill said. ""For instance, protections for pregnancy and pregnancy-related conditions are not terribly controversial. But it is certain you will not see any protections for transgender people.""

Hamill said it was the expansion of those protections that was the primary hook around which the lawsuits challenging the new regulations were framed, and were successful.

""I think we will know a lot more when we see, or start to hear, who [Trump] is likely to appoint as his secretary of education,"" Weimer said. ""That will inform us of how aggressive the agenda will be.""",[0]

Heavenly Father, in the mighty name of Jesus, we come before You, asking for peace as our nation approaches this critical election. Calm the hearts and minds of Your people as they weigh the possibilities of various outcomes (Philippians 4:6-7). We ask that You prevent conflicts, disruptions, or dishonesty. Guard each person who steps into a polling place and cover them with Your divine protection. Let peace and safety prevail (Psalm 34:7).

We thank You, Lord, for the privilege of being citizens of this nation and for the foundations upon which it stands. We ask that You restore integrity to the institution of our elections. While men may seek to deceive out of selfishness and the lust for power, we trust in You, for You alone hold true power, and all authority is from You (Romans 13:1). We give You all the praise!

Grant wisdom to those deciding their votes so that their choices align with Your will and bring about the greatest good for our future (James 1:5). Let integrity and righteousness be present from the casting of ballots to the counting and reporting. Protect us from fraud and manipulation (Deuteronomy 16:20). Stir the hearts of those who are unmotivated or indifferent, inspiring them to fulfill their duty to vote. May the weight of this responsibility rest upon them.

Father, we also ask that You uncover lies and reveal the truth. Strengthen our pursuit of truth and confound the spirit of deceit and misinformation. We reject falsehoods and ask that they be exposed (Psalm 25:5). We rebuke satan, the father of lies, in Jesus’ name (John 8:44). Our trust is in You, and we declare today that ""Victory belongs to the Lord"" (Proverbs 21:31).

Lord, we pray that You deliver victory to the righteous, to the Republican Party, and to Donald Trump, that they may lead this nation back to truth and righteousness. We believe this victory is crucial to saving America and restoring it to the principles upon which it was founded. Guide our nation back to You, and let Your hand of justice and mercy prevail.

Amen.

This is in an attempt to say they are both old men & create a false comparison.

Biden has been an absolute failure & imposter all his life, including during his vice presidency & presidency, living on taxpayer dollars, whereas Trump is the embodiment of success & the American dream !
Biden lacks moral clarity & conviction & flows with the wind as an absolute opportunistic failure, while Trump runs his life with conviction & character & a charismatic personality.
Just look at the rallies & the crowds Trump draws !

174,"🚨EXPLAINER – Biden, Harris, and their liberal allies in Congress are doing everything in their power to expedite the process of turning illegal aliens into citizens in an effort to radically transform the United States and influence the outcome of future elections.

Here’s a step-by-step on how their scheme works…

On their first day of office, Biden and Harris rescinded every critical Trump-era immigration policy and opened our borders to the world.

The result? The greatest immigration crisis in history. The overwhelming majority of those entering illegally were granted “parole” by the Biden-Harris DHS. This means that they were not only released from custody into the interior of the United States, but that they were also eligible to receive additional benefits once in the United States.

To make matters worse, in January 2023, the Biden-Harris Administration launched two unlawful federal programs to fast-track illegals into the United States so they don’t even have to try to sneak over the border–again relying upon an abuse of the “parole” authority.

1. First, they created the “CBP One” app — a phone app for illegals to click a few buttons, schedule their arrival, show up at the border, and be let into the interior of the United States en masse through abuses of the parole authority. Over 813,000 illegals have entered through this program already.

2. Second, they created the “CHNV” program – without Congressional approval – to fly 30,000 illegals from their country of origin every single month directly into the United States on commercial flights. Over 530,000 illegals have been flown into the interior of the United States since this program launched.

Once these aliens are paroled into the United States, they can obtain employment authorization and undercut the wages of United States workers. Even worse, the ordinary bars to obtaining a green card that would apply to most illegal aliens are removed. They can get a marriage or employment-based visa and become a lawful permanent resident/green card holder. Once they have had a green card for five years, they can naturalize and become citizens.

In addition, the Biden-Harris Administration is fast-tracking citizenship applications and naturalizing as many permanent residents as they can, as quickly as they can.

It gets worse…the mere presence of these millions of illegal aliens creates an entirely different set of problems for the security of our elections in the near term.

The federal government’s voter registration form does NOT require applicants to provide proof of citizenship. It merely requires voter registrants to sign a form swearing that “I am a United States citizen.”

The only thing stopping a noncitizen from registering to vote is their signature and promise.

Anyone who tries to tell you that there aren’t illegal aliens or noncitizens who have lied on this form is lying to you. Furthermore, there is the issue of faulty voter registrations at DMVs across the country, with clerks inadvertently or intentionally clicking a button and indicating incorrectly that a particular person obtaining a driver’s license–which many states provide for illegal aliens–is a citizen.

Illegal aliens and other noncitizens are on voter rolls all across the United States.

Accordingly, concerned States across the nation have submitted requests – under 8 U.S.C. § 1373(c) – to the Biden-Harris DHS to verify the citizenship or immigration status of registered voters on voter rolls when there are any reliable indicators that a voter may not be a U.S. citizen. However, the Mayorkas-led DHS is not providing states with access to this critical information.

Further, the Biden-Harris Administration has actually sued the State of Alabama for attempting to take reasonable measures to remove illegal aliens and noncitizens from their voter rolls.

AFL had to sue every county in the state of Arizona for refusing to purge potential noncitizens from the voter rolls—as required by AZ state law. We also just sued the Secretary of State in Arizona for illegally withholding a list of 218,000 registered voters who did not provide proof of citizenship.

Meanwhile, Biden and Kamala’s allies in Congress pushed to pass a Senate border bill that would lead to even more illegal aliens getting asylum, green cards, and ultimately pathways to citizenship.

Kamala has also pledged to support a pathway to citizenship for every illegal alien in the United States This would create tens of millions of additional voters across the country.

This is not a conspiracy, and this is not a warning of what *might* happen. This is happening right now. This is the reality under the Biden-Harris Administration.","[24, 29]"

176,"A repost - for a friend struggling after the debate:

My grandfather Charlie was not a sophisticated man. When he bought a car—always the same car, a blue Peugeot 305, replaced every few years with a newer model of the same exact make—he kept the seats covered in plastic to keep them eternally clean. When you asked him for an apple, he’d hold the fruit in his hand and rotate it like a tiny globe, peeling it with his pocketknife and making sure to remove only the skin and none of the flesh. When I ran away, as a child of 6 or 7, to explore a park nearby, he dashed out the door, wearing nothing but his underwear, and ran until he found me and hugged me tight. He didn’t even hear the passersby who pointed and laughed. Nothing mattered to him but his family.

He died when I was very young, so I know his life’s story only as a broad outline: Educated in a conservatory in Vienna, he was a promising young cellist and composer when he was spooked by the goosesteps of Hitler’s goons. He convinced two of his sisters to trade in a continental future for one less tender on the shores of Boston. Some of his friends, maybe even members of his family, pointed and laughed then, too, telling him he was hysterical, that he was getting it all wrong, that it couldn’t possibly be that bad. But grandpa Charlie wouldn’t listen: his simple heart advised him to take the thugs at their word and leave.

At least that’s how I imagine it—he never spoke of those early days, and his family and friends across Europe were all soon seized, deported, and murdered. I’m not sharing this particular story at this particular point in time to make some kind of historical analogy. Those are rarely useful even under the best of circumstances, and to compare Donald Trump to the Fuhrer or his ascent to the rise of the Third Reich is an absurd and reprehensible proposition. But I’ve been thinking a lot about my grandfather’s story this past week, and in it I find three simple commandments I can’t bring myself to dismiss.

The first, and most obvious, is this: treat every poisoned word as a promise. When a bigoted blusterer tells you he intends to force members of a religious minority to register with the authorities—much like those friends and family of Charlie's who stayed behind were forced to do before their horizon grew darker—believe him. Don’t try to be clever. Don’t lean on political intricacies or legislative minutia or historical precedents for comfort. Don’t write it off as propaganda, or explain it away as just an empty proclamation meant simply to pave the path to power. Take the haters at their word, and assume the worst is imminent.

Do that, and a second principle follows closely: You should treat people like adults, which means respecting them enough to demand that they understand the consequences of their actions. Explaining away or excusing the actions of others isn’t your job. Vienna in the first decades of the 20th century was a city inflamed with a desire to better understand the motives, hidden or otherwise, that move people to action. Freud and Kafka, Elias Canetti and Karl Kraus, Stefan Zweig and Franz Werfel—these were the eminences who crowded the same cafés Charlie and his musician friends most likely frequented. But while these beautiful minds struggled to understand the world around them, the world around them was consumed by simpler and more vicious appetites. Don’t waste any time, then, trying to understand: then as now, many were amused by the demagogue and moved by his vile vision. Some have perfectly reasonable explanations for their decisions, while others have little to go on but incoherent rage. It doesn’t matter. Voters are all adults, and all have made their choices, and it is now you who must brace for impact.

Whether you choose to forgive those, friends and strangers alike, who cast their votes so deplorably is a matter of personal choice, and none but the most imperious among us would advocate a categorical rejection of millions based on their electoral actions, no matter how irresponsible and dim. So while you make these personal calculations, remember that what matters now isn’t analysis: It’s survival.

Which leads me to the third principle, the one hardest to grasp: refuse to accept what’s going on as the new normal. Not now, not ever. In the months and years to come, decisions will be made that may strike you as perfectly sound, appointments announced that are inspired, and policies enacted you may even like. Friends and pundits will reach out to you and, invoking nuance, urge you to admit that there’s really nothing to fear, that things are more complex, that nothing is ever black or white. It’s a perfectly sound argument, of course, but it’s also dead wrong: This isn’t about policy or appointments or even about outcomes. This isn’t a political contest—it’s a moral crisis. When an inexperienced, thin-skinned demagogue rides into office by explaining away immensely complex problems while arguing that our national glory demands we strip millions of their dignity or their rights, our only duty is to resist by whatever means permitted us by law. The demagogue may boost the economy, sign beneficial treaties, and mend our ailing institutions, but his success can never be ours. Our greatness, to use a tired but true phrase, depends on our goodness, and to succeed, we must demand that our commander in chief come as close as is possible to reflecting the light of that goodness. There’s no point indulging in the kind of needlessly complex thinking that so often plagues the intelligent and the well-informed. There’s no room for reading tea leaves, for calculations or projections or clever takes. The only thing that matters now is the simple moral truth: This isn’t right. As long as we never forget that, we can never lose: As grandpa Charlie knew all too well, those who refuse to gradually put up with the darkness are making a very safe bet; if you’re wrong, there’s no harm, but if you’re right, you win more or less everything.

So forgive me if these next four years if I’m not inclined to be smart. When it comes to the task ahead, I’ve no interest in deep dives or shades of grey or mea culpas. Like my grandfather, I’m a simple Jew, and like him, I take danger at face value. When the levers of power are seized by the small hands of hateful men, you work hard, you stand with those who are most vulnerable, and you don’t give up until it’s morning again.",[0]

186,"TRUMP IS MENTALLY INCOMPETENT, MORALLY REPUGNANT AND A CRIMINAL – SO WHY AREN’T WE SAILING TO VICTORY? -- LOOK TO HISTORY
This election has an historic edge to it not only because Trump is historically awful and menacing. It’s also one of history’s potential turning points. Seeing similar currents around the world tells us that we are not just dealing with the domestic trends we observe, but something deeper and more fundamental. It is no coincidence that these echoes of the fascist past – and don’t dismiss the parallels: the path to nationalist bloodshed starts with words and the capture of institutions, not massacres – are crescendoing now, just as the living memory of WWII is dying away.

This blood-and-soil bullshit is an ineradicable, but deflectable, urge of human existence that lies dormant in the dark heart of humanity until the passage of generations has sufficiently blunted the memory of it and there is no one left – at least no one who still has any influence – who recognizes the early shoots of its return. People fall prey to it again and again not because they don’t care – it happens because they don’t believe it is happening until it’s well under way.

We are well past the beginning of it already when a person who whips up hatred as a tool of politics has held the presidency in this country, and who, with a phalanx of opportunists and toadies, is preparing to seize and permanently change our institutions. Like-minded figures, who all support each other and work to erode the domestic and international impediments to their transformative abuse of power, are in position around the world – a mutual admiration and support society of dictators and wannabes. Putin, Orbán, the rising nationalists throughout Europe, the goons around the world who regard human rights as an affront to their patriarchal sense of entitlement.

Joe Biden is one of the few world leaders left who is old enough to have grown up in the immediate aftermath of the war, and that has made him an invaluable leader in managing the threat of Russia, maintaining the NATO deterrent and understanding the undercurrents of world affairs. Trump, meanwhile, who grew up in the same period, has demonstrated how ignorant and useless he is – a man who could have known better, but whose lifelong dedication to learning and honing only what was necessary to feeding his own desires has instead cultivated an incorrigible stupidity and recklessness regarding everything that he was uninterested in learning about.

Joe Biden knows what the stakes are here, perhaps better than most of those who would replace him, though they are students of the same history even if their connection to it is more academic. But that wisdom should also tell him that many of the fateful decisions that led to disaster in the past were made by people who miscalculated in spite of being capable of knowing better. He should know that his value is in making the right decision, not being “the right person.” In 2020 the right decision was to be the person who was needed. Now the right decision is to see that he himself is putting the cause at risk.

In the end it will be up to us to make this moment a near miss instead of one of history’s calamitous turning points. The ancient elixir of intergroup hatred that is the basis of Trump’s appeal never leads to anything but violence in the end.

If Biden stays in the race, we’re going to have to work all the harder to win. And if he hands off to another ticket, it won’t be easy anyway. Either way, there is only one option compatible with our duty to avert disaster: VOTE FOR THE ONLY OPTION THAT WON’T GIVE US TRUMP: DEMOCRATS.",[0]

193,"ARE WE GOING TO GIVE OURSELVES A CHANCE TO WIN OR JUST WATCH THIS HAPPEN?
We got into the fight against Trump – in 2015 – because Trumpism is an attack on our shared reality that will destroy the rule of law, entrench injustices, spread hatred, lay the groundwork for wars and inflict cruelty on countless lives. His first term showed the outline of it and his second term would be an exponentially worse validation and implementation of everything evil about it. That stark reality demands two things of us as citizens: That we fight to defeat him at every juncture; and that we fight to defend reality. The only thing worse than losing this infernal election would be to lose it while also losing our grip on what makes us different than the tribal hallucinators whose collective decision to buy into a fake alternate reality has brought us to this brink.

We can’t beat Trumpism by becoming as tribal as them or by creating our own separate world of self-serving bullshit. We have to offer a sane, reality-based alternative to them. The fact that we acknowledge reality and spar over it with each other is *our strength* and the thing that distinguishes us from the orgy of lies and cynicism that they have become.

Don’t do it yourselves, and don’t ask us, to fight the Republicans’ collective delusion about Trump and society with an insistence on our side that we close ranks around some delusion of our own. I understand the motives of people who would put on the blinders to some extent for sake of a unity that feels so crucial in this situation, but that is the wrong path to winning and it is the wrong path to winning the longer battle against the insanity that they have imposed on our society.

We use the same eyes with which we view Trump to look at our own side of the fight. We *expect more* of the people on our side. We mean it when we say how much it matters, and we believe that everyone else does too. So we can’t look indulgently at Biden making the decision to name himself the quarterback of our team when he must have known that he can’t throw a 20-yard pass to save his life. That’s irresponsible. It’s a damn outrage, to be honest. We’ll give him the benefit of the doubt that he had more faith in his ability to win than he has demonstrated, but it’s no excuse for being willing to take the team down with him when the game situation is clear and the clock is ticking.

This is not just the case for staying true to ourselves and offering a real alternative to their cynical bullshit. It is also the case for winning. In 2020, Biden was the mirror opposite of Trump: Decent, competent, normal. But the course of world events, relentless Republican propaganda, Trump’s distorting influence and Biden’s unignorable aging process have nullified Biden’s 2020 political advantages over Trump. The insane reality is that many people don’t even think Biden is *more competent* than Trump. Stare at that line in disbelief … but it is true.

Even if you try to argue that the candidates are the same, although the consensus is that Biden has declined more than Trump (another insane premise, but electorally salient nonetheless), the situation is totally different. Whereas Biden in 2020 was the person who most comprehensively denied Trump any advantages, this time he is perhaps the only potential Democratic nominee who is not perceived as having *any* advantages over Trump other than the baseline that all of them have, which is better policies and manners.

After the debate gave Trump the upper hand in categories like mental acuity and debating that should be knockout disciplines for any sentient being facing Trump, Biden is the *worst* available option. Everyone else starts out with advantages over Trump in several other categories and the potential to build on that. What is Biden going to build on now? *He was losing before the debate.* How is he going to gain ground?

The best arguments for Biden at this point are the idea that his frailty could paradoxically focus people’s minds on the choice and make people think harder about how unfit Trump is; and the possibility that a handful of people who might have sat it out will rally to his side because they don’t like to see him pilloried in the public debate. Hope springs eternal, but are those the reeds we’re all supposed to cling to?

Contrast that with anyone else coming in and having an immediate bump into the margin of error and possibly the lead with a chance to sustain and build on it. Has anyone heard a better case for how we’re going to win with Biden? Any case at all? “It’s going to work somehow because it worked before (even though it wasn’t working before and just got worse)” and “it’s risky to change at this late stage” is not a game plan – it’s capitulation to fate. We have to give ourselves a chance to win. Snap out of the stupor, people!",[0]
194,"TRUMP’S A CONVICTED FELON AND THAT’S 100% LEGIT – BELIEVE YOUR EYES AND DEFEND REALITY
Trump’s a pig and we all know it. Yet every time he does something barbaric right in front of our eyes, 5 seconds later we are hearing from Republicans that it never happened (or was their beloved “nothingburger”) and the media are racing to report that Republicans are outraged, Republicans said Biden is actually far worse and EVEN IF the thing we all saw in real time were as bad as we think it is, it will somehow miraculously HELP TRUMP anyway. Gee, I wonder why …

Where’s the voice screaming DID YOU JUST EFFING SEE THAT? Where’s the sustained FOCUS ON WHAT HE DID? Who cares what liars are saying about it? I’m fed up with reading the line, “so and so said, without evidence …” … HOW ABOUT YOU DON’T PRINT UNSUBSTANTIATED BULLSHIT? Let them try to create their ridiculous fake reality without help from the normal world outside, and LET US LIVE IN REALITY without having to swat away their infernal mosquitos of deranged bullshit 24/7.

REALITY IS WHAT WE THINK IT IS. No, Trump wasn’t just convicted of 34 felonies based on some farfetched legal theory – he was convicted of doing EXACTLY WHAT IT APPEARED HE WAS DOING. He DID break the law for the express purpose of aiding his campaign – OF COURSE HE DID. It’s obvious ... and 12 jurors of his peers decided it was proven after 5 weeks of hearing evidence and Trump's best defense. And the reason here isn’t a long track record of precedents for it is because, DUH, there has never been a sleazebag running for president who would DO ANY OF THIS SHIT.

We don’t have to sit there stupefied, wondering what we can do – we can stand up for REALITY and insist on accountability for Trump and our fellow citizens based on REALITY. Of course Republicans are going to spend every second of the next 6 months trying to convince themselves and others that it’s not TRUMP, it’s not THEM who are assaulting reality and destroying the fabric of our democracy to turn their self-serving lies into truth – it’s US who are attacking them and US who are weaponizing whatever …. you know, that we’re doing everything THEY ARE ACTUALLY DOING.

Don’t listen to it. Shout it down. Believe your own damn eyes. Speak the truth.

Yes, 2024 is about keeping Trump out of the White House. But it’s also about making sure Democrats can defeat Republicans everywhere. It’s about the policies we’re fighting for, and the people who those policies benefit.

That’s why I’m keeping up the fight for policies like universal child care, taxing the rich, regulating Big Banks, and making the Supreme Court follow a standard code of ethics. Policies that put power in the hands of working people instead of benefiting the wealthy and powerful.

208,"Hi! It’s Robert Reich here, and unfortunately, I’ve got some bad news: One of the nation's top election forecasters, Nate Silver, is giving Donald Trump a 64.4% chance of winning the presidency.

Despite the energy and hope that the Harris-Walz campaign has brought to the table, if the election were tomorrow, the most likely outcome would be Vice President Harris narrowly winning the popular vote and Trump winning the Electoral College.

We’ve been here before—Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency because of the Electoral College and the Supreme Court. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by millions but lost the Electoral College, and thus the presidency.

That's why I'm asking today if you can donate whatever you can afford to help my good friends at MoveOn get out the vote in critical battleground states. MoveOn has an incredible track record of turning out the precise voters who will make the difference in this election: people with progressive values who do not consistently vote. MoveOn's special sauce is engaging these voters on the issues they care about and getting them to the polls.

And how do they do it? MoveOn has pioneered a voter turnout method that’s proven to be as much as FIVE times more effective than other methods. It’s called ""vote tripling,"" and it’s based on relational organizing—the principle that people are more likely to listen to their friends and social networks than anonymous ads and outreach. MoveOn’s tried and tested methods to get voters to the polls are what bring me hope.

We can and we must do more to turn out inconsistent voters in battleground states—starting right now. Will you make a monthly donation to help MoveOn power their critical get-out-the-vote program, stop MAGA, and secure a decisive win for Kamala Harris?

254,"The general election—and the future of our nation—will likely be decided by a tiny number of votes in a very, very small handful of battleground states.

How tiny a number of votes? Well, on average, Biden won by only FIVE ✋votes per precinct in the critical states of Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin in the 2020 presidential election. Without those crucial votes—a miniscule 0.00026% of all votes cast in the election—Trump would still be president.

And in this year’s election, polling in battleground districts shows projections within the margin of error, making the outcome hard to predict. That’s why it’s even more critical that we spread the word and contact voters about showing up to the polls.
Voter targeting matters. And getting these voters to the polls is MoveOn’s secret sauce.

In 2020, MoveOn’s innovative get-out-the-vote program resulted in 50,000 unlikely voters casting a ballot in battleground districts. To replicate our success and defeat dangerous MAGA candidates this year, we’re executing a state-of-the-art, evidence-based campaign to identify and turn out the critical voters we'll need to win in November.

MoveOn has an in-house analytics team of top data scientists with advanced degrees in the field. Between them, our team has dozens of years of technical experience building sophisticated predictive models.

Our team of data scientists built a model to identify the precise voters we'll need to turn out to win. And then they worked to figure out the right messages to communicate with these voters.

Our methods are proven and effective. But with Election Day fast approaching, we need your support to reach as many of these key voters as possible. Can you make a donation now to power MoveOn’s work to turn out the voters who can tip the victory to us this November and stop Trump, MAGA, and Project 2025 from taking over our democracy?

307,"The general election—and the future of our nation—will likely be decided by a tiny number of votes in a very, very small handful of battleground states. How tiny a number of votes? Well, on average, Biden won by only FIVE ✋votes per precinct in the critical states of Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin in the 2020 presidential election.

Voter targeting matters. And getting these voters to the polls is MoveOn’s secret sauce.

In 2020, MoveOn’s innovative get-out-the-vote program resulted in 50,000 unlikely voters casting a ballot in battleground districts. To replicate our success and defeat dangerous MAGA candidates this year, we’re executing a state-of-the-art, evidence-based campaign to identify and turn out the critical voters we'll need to win in November. One of our proven tactics, “vote tripling,” leverages the power of relational organizing and is up to FIVE times more effective than other, more traditional get-out-the-vote methods.

But with Election Day around the corner, we have no time to waste. Can you make a donation now to power MoveOn’s work to turn out the key voters who can tip the victory to us this November and stop Trump, MAGA, and Project 2025 from taking over our democracy?

355,"The general election—and the future of our nation—will likely be decided by a tiny number of votes in a very, very small handful of battleground states.

How tiny a number of votes? Well, on average, Biden won by only FIVE ✋votes per precinct in the critical states of Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin in the 2020 presidential election. Without those crucial votes—a miniscule 0.00026% of all votes cast in the election—Trump would still be president.

And in this year’s election, polling in battleground districts shows projections within the margin of error, making the outcome hard to predict. That’s why it’s even more critical that we spread the word and contact voters about showing up to the polls.
Voter targeting matters. And getting these voters to the polls is MoveOn’s secret sauce.

In 2020, MoveOn’s innovative get-out-the-vote program resulted in 50,000 unlikely voters casting a ballot in battleground districts. To replicate our success and defeat dangerous MAGA candidates this year, we’re executing a state-of-the-art, evidence-based campaign to identify and turn out the critical voters we'll need to win in November.

MoveOn has an in-house analytics team of top data scientists with advanced degrees in the field. Between them, our team has dozens of years of technical experience building sophisticated predictive models.

Our team of data scientists built a model to identify the precise voters we'll need to turn out to win. And then they worked to figure out the right messages to communicate with these voters.

Our methods are proven and effective. But with Election Day fast approaching, we need your support to reach as many of these key voters as possible. Can you make a donation now to power MoveOn’s work to turn out the voters who can tip the victory to us this November and stop Trump, MAGA, and Project 2025 from taking over our democracy?

360,"Cori Bush has been a force of nature in Congress — introducing transformative legislation, fighting to hold insurrectionists accountable, spotlighting the need for humanity in government, and delivering for the people of her St. Louis district.

Not only that, but she made history as the first nurse and the first Black woman to EVER represent Missouri in federal office. She is the type of committed champion of working people we need more of in Congress.

But she's facing strong political headwinds from the millions of dollars Republican-aligned groups are spending against her this year. Her primary opponent is funded by the same folks who bankrolled Josh Hawley, Nikki Haley, and Donald Trump's campaigns — and he has previously worked to elect an anti-abortion Republican.

Let's get this straight: If you work for Republicans and take donations from Republicans, you're a Republican.

366,"Robert Reich: Have you heard about Project 2025?

It's a nearly 1,000-page blueprint for turning America into a white Christian nationalist police state … all by executive order and without an act of Congress.

If Trump becomes president, then with the stroke of his pen …

Abortion will be banned nationwide. The DOJ will no longer be independent—and there will be no one left to stop Trump from charging his political opponents with crimes. The Department of Education will be eliminated. The Insurrection Act will be used to shut down protests and deploy the National Guard for partisan reasons.

But there’s hope. The vast majority of Americans are AGAINST Project 2025's proposed policies.

We've got to raise awareness of Project 2025 and Trump's plans so that voters keep him out of the Oval Office.

And research shows that about one-third of people under 30—a key demographic in deciding this year’s election—get their news from TikTok, where MAGA is dominating right now. When Trump joined TikTok, within three days he had 5 million followers—14 times as many followers as President Biden.

That's why I'm excited by MoveOn's plans to build a cadre of up to 200 social media influencers who can help expose the dangers of Project 2025 to their massive, dedicated audiences.

Will you help my good friends at MoveOn reach as many voters as possible before the election? By starting a monthly donation today, you will power MoveOn’s work to spread the truth to millions of people about Trump and Project 2025's Christian nationalist agenda.

MoveOn is prepared to defend our safe and secure election system against MAGA’s sabotage efforts and ensure that the will of the people prevails. Our leaders do not get to pick their voters. The stakes are too high to silence us.

MoveOn has been closely tracking the plans being put in place by Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans to contest the election results and attempt to overthrow the will of the people. They include launching dozens of lawsuits, tapping into election denier allies on local election boards to delay or stop vote certification, and more.

That's why, several months ago, MoveOn started preparations to make sure we’re ready to keep up the fight to protect our safe and secure election system and ensure that every vote 🗳️ is counted.

We’ve seen this old, tired playbook before. We all remember Trump's sham lawsuits and lies after the 2020 election, all setting the stage for the deadly attempted coup on January 6, 2021, to undermine the will of the voters.

But we have stopped these attacks before, and we can do it again now. That's why our preparations to respond to any attempted sabotage are so important.

392,"I want to talk about why we’re paying close attention to our grassroots fundraising performance right now, and why your next donation would be particularly meaningful today.

Our re-election campaign is funded by grassroots, small-dollar donations. In fact, 99% of the donations we’ve received this year have been $100 or less. That’s a testament to the strength of this truly grassroots-powered movement. And that's exactly the type of campaign I want to run.

But a few updates in our race have made us keep a close eye on our fundraising right now:

1️⃣ A new right-wing Super PAC launched to target me and boost one of my GOP opponents. It’s got ties to the Trump administration, Mitch McConnell, and powerful corporate interests — from Big Oil to Big Pharma to the big banks.

2️⃣ That same GOP challenger the Super PAC is supporting recently announced that he’d invested $1 million of his own money into his campaign.

3️⃣ A second Republican challenger with ties to wealthy special interests recently announced a campaign to run against me too.

I know our movement is stronger than the special interests supporting my opponents, but our grassroots fundraising model only works if everyone keeps pitching in whatever they can, whenever they can. Will you chip in $28 or anything you can today to ensure we can compete and continue fighting for working people in the Senate?",[0]

Because I too have felt the electricity and energy of the Harris-Walz campaign.

But if the election were tomorrow, the most likely outcome would be Vice President Kamala Harris narrowly winning the popular vote but Donald Trump winning the Electoral College.

We’ve been here before—Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency because of the Electoral College and the Supreme Court. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by millions but lost the Electoral College, and thus the presidency.

It's because of the Electoral College that one of the nation's top election forecasters, Nate Silver, gives Trump a 64.4% chance of winning the presidency. According to his highly respected, nonpartisan model, Vice President Harris has only a 35.3% chance of victory.

This is a gruesome prediction, but I have hope. My good friends at MoveOn are working around the clock to get out the vote in critical battleground states. MoveOn has an incredible track record of turning out the precise voters who will make the difference in this election: people with progressive values who do not consistently vote. MoveOn's special sauce is engaging these voters on the issues they care about and getting them to the polls.

The only way for us to win this election is to turn out these voters—including young people and those in marginalized communities—people who face HUGE obstacles to voting, in part due to MAGA voter suppression laws and the Supreme Court’s decimation of the Voting Rights Act.

We can and we must do more to turn out inconsistent voters in battleground states—starting right now. Will you make a monthly donation to help MoveOn power their critical get-out-the-vote program, combat voter suppression, and secure a decisive win for Kamala Harris?

Donald Trump’s lawyers recently told the Supreme Court that presidents should be able to murder political rivals or stage coups—and multiple Supreme Court justices acted like it was a serious argument.

This is how authoritarianism is normalized.

I’m outraged. I’m disgusted. And I’m motivated to fight like hell to save our democracy—we certainly can’t rely on the courts to save it. Our only way forward is to defeat Trump decisively at the ballot box in November. And that's why I'm reaching out to you today.

My good friends at MoveOn are the best in the business at engaging and turning out voters at scale, and I'm impressed by their data-driven, innovative, and bold plan to help defeat Trump and save our democracy this November.

The data are clear that winning this neck-and-neck election comes down to turning out people who might otherwise not go to the polls at all.

MoveOn’s masses of volunteers and millions of members are reaching out to 11 million of these voters in battleground states who are CRITICAL to defeating Trump and MAGA this November.

Our democracy is hanging by a thread—the nation's highest court is considering whether presidents can murder political opponents and order military coups. To prevent our democracy from slipping into a dictatorship, we MUST defeat Trump decisively in November. It truly is up to us.

President Biden and Donald J. Trump are neck and neck in this presidential race. The lead changes like a game of hot potato — one minute up, the next tied. It’s a razor-thin margin that could tilt at any moment.

Trump’s campaign is being backed by wealthy right-wing donors whose goal is to create division among Americans. Earlier this month, Trump’s momentum surged, prompting a billionaire ally to inject a staggering $50 MILLION into his campaign, making one of the largest donations ever seen in political history.

Trump’s agenda is clear: dismantle democracy, roll back progress, and impose his dangerous vision on our nation. We’ve seen the chaos and division he brings while in office. We can’t let that happen again.

To secure Biden’s re-election, we must turn out progressive Democratic voters in swing states.

Leaders We Deserve is doing everything we can to elect young leaders across the country, and just as importantly, to diversify the strategy for Biden’s reelection by turning out progressive Democratic voters in swing districts that could determine the outcome of the presidential election in November.

If you are feeling as nervous as I am, I hope I can convince you to turn that anxiety into action. Our slate of endorsed candidates, all Gen Z or Millennials who refuse corporate contributions and focus on a progressive agenda, are working to inspire voter turnout in pivotal districts and help lift Biden to victory.

❌Contraception and abortion banned
❌Social Security and Medicare abolished
❌Corporate regulations gutted

❌Protections for LGBTQ+ people gone

500,"Hi! It’s Robert Reich here, and unfortunately, I’ve got some bad news: One of the nation's top election forecasters, Nate Silver, is giving Donald Trump a 64.4% chance of winning the presidency.

Despite the energy and hope that the Harris-Walz campaign has brought to the table, if the election were tomorrow, the most likely outcome would be Vice President Harris narrowly winning the popular vote and Trump winning the Electoral College.

We’ve been here before—Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency because of the Electoral College and the Supreme Court. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by millions but lost the Electoral College, and thus the presidency.

That's why I'm asking today if you can donate whatever you can afford to help my good friends at MoveOn get out the vote in critical battleground states. MoveOn has an incredible track record of turning out the precise voters who will make the difference in this election: people with progressive values who do not consistently vote. MoveOn's special sauce is engaging these voters on the issues they care about and getting them to the polls.

And how do they do it? MoveOn has pioneered a voter turnout method that’s proven to be as much as FIVE times more effective than other methods. It’s called ""vote tripling,"" and it’s based on relational organizing—the principle that people are more likely to listen to their friends and social networks than anonymous ads and outreach. MoveOn’s tried and tested methods to get voters to the polls are what bring me hope.

We can and we must do more to turn out inconsistent voters in battleground states—starting right now. Will you make a monthly donation to help MoveOn power their critical get-out-the-vote program, stop MAGA, and secure a decisive win for Kamala Harris?

As we prepare for COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, and the next four years in the U.S., we remain clear-eyed about the weight of the U.S.’s role as a leading historical emitter and major oil and gas producer. While it is very possible that the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris Agreement under the Trump administration, we are committed to showing up, alongside our global partners, to hold the U.S. accountable and to advocate for bold and transformative policies that prioritize climate justice and human rights.

This is a critical time for climate action and WECAN will be at the UN COP29 climate negotiations from November 11 - 22. We are honored to be advocating with an outstanding Frontline and Indigenous Women's Delegation to demand world governments take bold and transformative action for climate justice. WECAN will present policy interventions, on the ground climate justice projects, reports, systemic change frameworks and strategies within a climate justice and feminist analysis as we call for just solutions to shape a healthy and equitable world. We will be engaging in the following topics at COP29:

🔸Robust and transformative climate finance commitments in the NCQG
🔸Government commitments to loss and damage
🔸An equitable fair, fast, and funded fossil fuel phaseout
🔸Gender-responsive and gender just climate policies
🔸Indigenous rights and sovereignty as a climate solution
🔸Just Transition and feminist and beyond growth economic models
🔸Rights of Nature
🔸Forest and biodiversity protection, and defending land defenders
🔸Denouncing carbon offsets and false solutions
🔸Holding corporations and financial institutions accountable
🔸International multilateral cooperation

Because I too have felt the electricity and energy of the Harris-Walz campaign.

But if the election were tomorrow, the most likely outcome would be Vice President Kamala Harris narrowly winning the popular vote but Donald Trump winning the Electoral College.

We’ve been here before—Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency because of the Electoral College and the Supreme Court. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by millions but lost the Electoral College, and thus the presidency.

It's because of the Electoral College that one of the nation's top election forecasters, Nate Silver, gives Trump a 64.4% chance of winning the presidency. According to his highly respected, nonpartisan model, Vice President Harris has only a 35.3% chance of victory.

This is a gruesome prediction, but I have hope. My good friends at MoveOn are working around the clock to get out the vote in critical battleground states. MoveOn has an incredible track record of turning out the precise voters who will make the difference in this election: people with progressive values who do not consistently vote. MoveOn's special sauce is engaging these voters on the issues they care about and getting them to the polls.

The only way for us to win this election is to turn out these voters—including young people and those in marginalized communities—people who face HUGE obstacles to voting, in part due to MAGA voter suppression laws and the Supreme Court’s decimation of the Voting Rights Act.

We can and we must do more to turn out inconsistent voters in battleground states—starting right now. Will you make a monthly donation to help MoveOn power their critical get-out-the-vote program, combat voter suppression, and secure a decisive win for Kamala Harris?

When young progressives run for office, young voters turn out in unprecedented numbers. We've seen it happen – youth turnout increases by 61% in battleground states when there's a young, progressive candidate on the ballot.

This surge in youth voting is our best defense against Donald Trump and MAGA extremists retaking the White House. But to make it happen, we need to get these candidates on the ballot. That's where you come in.

Your $5 donation to Leaders We Deserve:
— helps us identify and support young, progressive candidates who are committed to gun reform, reproductive rights, and climate action.
— provides these candidates with the resources they need to run effective campaigns.
— and most importantly, inspires thousands of young voters to make their voices heard at the polls.

I've been on the road, rallying with progressive leaders across the country. The energy is palpable. For the first time in years, it feels like we're at a tipping point. This election really could transform our political system into one that works for everyday people.

But we can't do it alone. Leaders We Deserve doesn't take money from large corporations – we rely entirely on grassroots support from people like you who believe in a better future.

Donate now. Let's put young progressives on the ballot, turn out young voters, and build a country that works for all of us – not just the wealthy few. Because when young progressives run, democracy wins. And with your help, we will win.",[0]

Here’s why:",[0]
622,"The general election—and the future of our nation—will likely be decided by a tiny number of votes in a very, very small handful of battleground states.

How tiny a number of votes? Well, on average, Biden won by only FIVE ✋votes per precinct in the critical states of Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin in the 2020 presidential election. Without those crucial votes—a miniscule 0.00026% of all votes cast in the election—Trump would still be president.

And in this year’s election, polling in battleground districts shows projections within the margin of error, making the outcome hard to predict. That’s why it’s even more critical that we spread the word and contact voters about showing up to the polls.
Voter targeting matters. And getting these voters to the polls is MoveOn’s secret sauce.

In 2020, MoveOn’s innovative get-out-the-vote program resulted in 50,000 unlikely voters casting a ballot in battleground districts. To replicate our success and defeat dangerous MAGA candidates this year, we’re executing a state-of-the-art, evidence-based campaign to identify and turn out the critical voters we'll need to win in November.

MoveOn has an in-house analytics team of top data scientists with advanced degrees in the field. Between them, our team has dozens of years of technical experience building sophisticated predictive models.

Our team of data scientists built a model to identify the precise voters we'll need to turn out to win. And then they worked to figure out the right messages to communicate with these voters.

Our methods are proven and effective. But with Election Day fast approaching, we need your support to reach as many of these key voters as possible. Can you make a donation now to power MoveOn’s work to turn out the voters who can tip the victory to us this November and stop Trump, MAGA, and Project 2025 from taking over our democracy?

If elected, Vance would be the thug Trump needs to execute his far-right, Christian Fundamentalist agenda outlined in Project 2025.

Here is some wild sh*t we know about authoritarian Vance (and to nobody’s surprise, they’re all key highlights of Project 2025):

1. Extreme Views on Abortion Access: Vance has consistently opposed abortion access, supporting restrictive measures like Texas's S.B. 8 and the criminalization of women who cross state lines for abortions.

2. Naked Authoritarian Politics: Vance advocates for drastic changes to government operations, including firing mid-level bureaucrats and replacing them with loyalists. Simply put, he’s anti-democracy and unafraid to own it.

3. Anti-Women: Vance has criticized no-fault divorce laws, arguing that they make it too easy for people to leave marriages. This stance will trap women in abusive relationships, making it harder for them to escape domestic violence and protect their safety.

The Trump/Vance ticket fits Project 2025 like a key in a lock, and would reshape the federal government and undermine our freedoms and democracy as we know it.

The overqualified woman leading the Democratic presidential ticket just selected an affable guy named Tim with a long career of public service to be her running mate.

👎 The Republican candidate for president, Donald Trump, is historically unpopular and saying more deranged things every day. He’s poisoning our culture and our political discourse.

⏸️ Oh, sorry – did you think we were talking about the state of the race right now? Scroll back up and read that again. ⏪ That’s exactly what the political landscape felt like in the summer of 2016.

Do you remember what happened next? Let us remind you. Donald Trump won the White House with 304 electoral votes. 🚨 We didn’t see it coming, the pollsters and mainstream media didn’t see it coming. We were shocked and devastated by the results.

That is why we cannot afford to be complacent. Our mission at Forward Blue is to save democracy by registering and turning out Democratic voters. Turnout can make all the difference in an election, so our efforts focus on mobilizing voters who might otherwise not participate.

We know it feels like we have the momentum, but we know from experience that everything can change on a dime. We are working tirelessly to ensure that every eligible voter has an opportunity to cast their ballot in this election.

657,"Hi! It’s Robert Reich here, and unfortunately, I’ve got some bad news: One of the nation's top election forecasters, Nate Silver, is giving Donald Trump a 64.4% chance of winning the presidency.

Despite the energy and hope that the Harris-Walz campaign has brought to the table, if the election were tomorrow, the most likely outcome would be Vice President Harris narrowly winning the popular vote and Trump winning the Electoral College.

We’ve been here before—Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency because of the Electoral College and the Supreme Court. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by millions but lost the Electoral College, and thus the presidency.

That's why I'm asking today if you can donate whatever you can afford to help my good friends at MoveOn get out the vote in critical battleground states. MoveOn has an incredible track record of turning out the precise voters who will make the difference in this election: people with progressive values who do not consistently vote. MoveOn's special sauce is engaging these voters on the issues they care about and getting them to the polls.

And how do they do it? MoveOn has pioneered a voter turnout method that’s proven to be as much as FIVE times more effective than other methods. It’s called ""vote tripling,"" and it’s based on relational organizing—the principle that people are more likely to listen to their friends and social networks than anonymous ads and outreach. MoveOn’s tried and tested methods to get voters to the polls are what bring me hope.

We can and we must do more to turn out inconsistent voters in battleground states—starting right now. Will you make a monthly donation to help MoveOn power their critical get-out-the-vote program, stop MAGA, and secure a decisive win for Kamala Harris?

693,"The Deplorable State of Political Hatred

This weekend's assassination attempt on Donald Trump is a stark reminder of how deplorable our political hatred has become. We've devolved into acts of political violence that do nothing but harm all Americans—red and blue alike—while our foreign adversaries, like Russia, China, and Iran, stand to gain.

This incident clearly demonstrates that the government can't save you if they can't even keep our most protected politicians safe from a random 20-year-old with no military or professional weapons training. The line between life and death is sometimes literally inches, as the bullet that hit Trump's ear was perhaps as close as an inch, if not less, from killing him. In a game of inches, do you rely on someone else with your life? It didn't work for Trump, so why would it work for you?

You need to be self-reliant, self-made, and self-sufficient. Because when those bullets zip by, you are clearly on your own. Take charge of your life because you are all you can depend on. Trust in your abilities, prepare for the unexpected, and live with the knowledge that your safety and success are in your hands.

722,"HERE'S WHY TRUMP MAY WIN THE DEBATE ON TUESDAY NIGHT.........‼️ ‼️

Since replacing President Biden on the Democratic ticket just weeks ago, Kamala Harris has pretty much been on a roll following a very strong convention performance. But is the worm about to turn (yeah, that's an old saying)?

Trump has plenty of ammunition in his gun belt (yeah, another old saying) to put a stop to the Harris momentum, especially in these areas:

💥The Border
💥Inflation, grocery costs, gas prices
💥The terrible Afghanistan Evacuation
💥The question of President Biden's capacity to govern
💥His view of his own ""great economy"" that he left the Democrats

As everyone, even his most ardent supporters, acknowledge, Trump has a somewhat dubious relationship with accuracy and is prone to blustery exaggeration. It even leads to friendly laughter at his rallies. But here's the rub................

🔥🔥🔥A potential debate problem for him is that a great deal of his bluster and exaggeration and his dubious relationship with accuracy has led many of his supporters (and likely a number of ""undecided"" voters) to have taken everything he says as true and accurate.

And if those inaccuracies are exposed at the debate, even in the areas above where he APPEARS to have an advantage, it could prove to be disaster. This might be especially true when undecided voters paying attention begin to see a bigger picture beyond Trump's traditional ""sound bite"" attacks and proposals.

FOR EXAMPLE:

⭐️⭐️ THE BORDER: Trump can certainly make the case that too many illegal immigrants are crossing the border and maybe win voters on that issue. But he does need to be careful because, once again, his bluster and exaggeration have led to some misrepresentations.

❓ ❓WHAT IF Harris points out that immigration has been an issue not for the last 4 years, but for the last 50, and neither Republicans nor Democrats have made much headway in fixing the immigration system.

And what if she points out that Biden/Harris were the first ones to finally get the toughest immigration bill written in a bipartisan manner in the last 50 years....and Trump told the House members to kill the bill?

And what if Harris points out that Trump's ""bluster and exaggeration"" about all the immigrants being from prisons and mental institutions is absolute baloney (which it is)?

And what if Harris points out that Trump's assertion that immigrants have high crime rates in America is totally untrue (which it is). Immigrants have LOWER rates of crime than American citizens, probably because they already know they are on thin ice and don't want to be deported if caught in a crime.

And what if Harris points out that illegal immigration is now at a lower rate than at any time during Trump's term?

🔥🔥🔥Should these above truths become obvious to thinking undecided voters, Trump could be in trouble even on what appears to be a strong issue for him.

⭐️⭐️BUT WHAT ABOUT INFLATION, GROCERY PRICES, GAS PRICES? TRUMP HAS A STRONG CASE THERE, RIGHT? HE'S BEEN POINTING OUT BIDEN'S TERRIBLE RECORD THERE FOR MONTHS, AND HARRIS WAS PART OF THAT.

❓❓Unfortunately for Trump, he may be exposed to disaster here, too, if the undecided voters think a bit more deeply than Trump wants them to.

****Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy helped inflation along quite a bit, leaving office with the biggest 4-year addition to the debt in our history, nearly $7.8 TRILLION (with a T) dollars. No one has ever had a deficit grow that much in four years, not even close.

****Second, inflation WAS WORLDWIDE, not just a USA phenomena. How did so-called ""Sleepy Joe"" cause WORLDWIDE inflation?

Thinking undecided voters may suddenly realize that coming out of Covid caused greater demand while manufacturing, businesses, agriculture were all just re-starting, so supply was very low.

And employees were slow to come back to work, and supply chains across the world were broken.

SO.....high demand, low supply, across the world. Classic economics......higher prices.

🔥🔥🔥To blame Biden is, again, not quite accurate or true......which we all agree is a habit with Trump. He may take a hit if he tries the ""Inflation is Biden and Harris's fault"" line in the debates.

Oh, and gas prices? Simple. The president doesn't set gas prices, and during Biden's term we are supplying more oil than at any other time in our history. Trump will need to tread very carefully.

⭐️⭐️ AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL: Trump will of course attack the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal which occurred after he left the presidency. He has already placed blame squarely on President Biden and will shift that to Harris. BUT.........

❓❓ WHAT IF Harris points out these truths (below) to thinking voters about how the entire withdrawal was impacted by Trump's earlier actions (all true):

**** Trump negotiated the withdrawal directly with ""his friends"" the Taliban, and excluded the Afghan Army, our allies.

****Trump drew down USA forces from 13,000 to 2,000 before leaving office, leaving the USA contingent very exposed.

****Trump shut down every airbase in Afghanistan except one as part of the ""deal,"" making it impossible to extract all of our Afghanistan allies and assets.

****As part of his ""deal,"" Trump released 5,000 Taliban captured prisoners, one of who BECAME THE LEADER OF THE TALIBAN WHO ATTACKED DURING THE WITHDRAWAL.

****Agreed in the ""deal"" to a May 1 exit (shortly after Biden took office), Trump bragging publicly that he ""didn't need an exit strategy"" because his ""friends"" the Taliban promised a safe exit.

****Saying he won the 2020 election (which he lost by 7 million votes, verified), Trump refused to brief the incoming Biden team on the Afghanistan situation (and several other matters)

🔥🔥🔥Trump and his team never shared these actions with the public, and if voters learn them now, Trump's chances to win the debate may be severely damaged. He was less than truthful, which has been an ongoing habit, even his supporters agree.

⭐️⭐️ HIDING BIDEN'S CAPACITY TO GOVERN Trump will surely bring this up, as it appears to be a weakness for Harris, potentially hiding President Biden's inability to govern.

❓❓But again, Trump must be careful with his perceived advantage on this issue, first because Biden has given several strong speeches since the debate.

Secondly, a debate format is not how a president governs, particularly Biden. His history is as a listener and discusser, not a debater. Biden may operate quite well in that setting, and Harris may easily make that case with some very good examples. Trump's assumptions and assertions could easily be trampled here.

🔥🔥🔥Finally, Trump himself is beginning to show his age. His speeches are now widely panned as being scattered, unfocused, belligerent. His own supporters are beginning to leave his speeches early. He appears to be losing his audience with ""the same old stuff' only more garbled and out-of-focus. Again, Trump needs to watch out here, he could trap himself.

⭐️⭐WHAT ABOUT THE GREAT ECONOMY TRUMP LEFT US? This may be Trump's biggest exaggeration and most vulnerable spot. He needs to be careful not to let his bluster get in the way of accuracy here, because it will be pretty easy to show him wrong.

❓❓What if Harris points out that Trump's brag about ""having the strongest economy in our history"" is simply WRONG (which it is)? SEVERAL other presidents have presided over stronger economic growth, and it's all documented.

And, as noted, Trump ended with a $7.8 TRILLION deficit, the very largest in our history over a four year term. And the problem is, he told voters he would balance the budget and ""it would be easy."" Nope, not even close.

And Trump's argument here exposes him to discussion about Covid, where there is wide agreement that he did not handle it well. Remember ""don't worry, it's under control,"" and ""it will be over soon when the weather warms up, maybe April."" Over a million died after those comments, and the United States economy came to nearly a total halt.

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥AS WE CAN SEE WITH THESE EXAMPLES, TRUMP HAS SOME ADVANTAGES THAT COULD LEAD TO HIS VICTORY IN THE DEBATE. BUT BECAUSE OF HIS PREVIOUS POOR RELATIONSHIP WITH ACCURACY AND HIS TENDENCY TO BLUSTER AND EXAGGERATE, HIS BIGGEST ISSUES ALSO LEAVE HIM HEAVILY EXPOSED IF MORE DETAILS COME OUT.

735,"Inc. reported in a recent article that “companies and individuals associated with the cryptocurrency industry have been responsible for nearly HALF of all corporate money contributed in the 2024 election.” The gargantuan wealth 💰that crypto is funneling into our election is a danger to our democracy.

Cryptocurrency firm Coinbase is the top organizational donor in the 2024 election, donating more than $91 MILLION to political causes just this year, including many pro-crypto Super PACs. When companies like Coinbase donate to political causes, it’s not philanthropy—they expect a return on their investment. And that’s exactly what they’d be getting with Donald Trump, who has touted himself as “the Crypto president.”

Since 2020, the number of crypto lobbyists registered in Washington has quadrupled 💥, and the industry is spending at record levels 📈in this election. Why? Because we’re in a defining moment that will set the standard for crypto’s regulations for the next four years and beyond.

Similar to the fossil fuel and gun industries, investments by crypto firms are meant to convince politicians to have lax rules and pad their bottom line instead of protecting the interests of the people and planet. That’s one reason why MoveOn is going all in to turn out key voters in battleground districts to defeat “Crypto President” Trump and protect our democracy ✊.

Here at MoveOn, we’re the nation's largest independent progressive political organization, staffed by foremost experts on using cutting-edge digital technology to increase voter turnout. But as a grassroots organization, we can make this critical work happen only with your support.

Will you start a monthly donation to MoveOn today? Your donation will help mobilize key voters to show up in full force to defeat Trump, elect Kamala Harris, and deliver a decisive blow to wealthy interests like the crypto lobby that corrupt our democracy.

Because I too have felt the electricity and energy of the Harris-Walz campaign.

But if the election were tomorrow, the most likely outcome would be Vice President Kamala Harris narrowly winning the popular vote but Donald Trump winning the Electoral College.

We’ve been here before—Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency because of the Electoral College and the Supreme Court. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by millions but lost the Electoral College, and thus the presidency.

It's because of the Electoral College that one of the nation's top election forecasters, Nate Silver, gives Trump a 64.4% chance of winning the presidency. According to his highly respected, nonpartisan model, Vice President Harris has only a 35.3% chance of victory.

This is a gruesome prediction, but I have hope. My good friends at MoveOn are working around the clock to get out the vote in critical battleground states. MoveOn has an incredible track record of turning out the precise voters who will make the difference in this election: people with progressive values who do not consistently vote. MoveOn's special sauce is engaging these voters on the issues they care about and getting them to the polls.

The only way for us to win this election is to turn out these voters—including young people and those in marginalized communities—people who face HUGE obstacles to voting, in part due to MAGA voter suppression laws and the Supreme Court’s decimation of the Voting Rights Act.

We can and we must do more to turn out inconsistent voters in battleground states—starting right now. Will you make a monthly donation to help MoveOn power their critical get-out-the-vote program, combat voter suppression, and secure a decisive win for Kamala Harris?

""With fear for our democracy, I dissent,"" Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her scathing dissenting opinion from the Supreme Court's ruling which gives presidents immunity for ""official acts."" She wrote, ""the President is now a king above the law.""
The decision paves the way for a future president to take bribes, engage in a military coup, and politically prosecute political rivals with impunity—or even outright order their assassination.
And it has created a horrifying possibility: a Donald Trump presidency with unlimited power granted by the Supreme Court to commit criminal acts.

823,"$16.59 Mexican Vanilla Just $5!
July 6 was the day Donald Trump launched his campaign for president by labeling the Mexican people rapists and bringers of “tremendous infectious disease” across the border. Republican primary voters never looked back.

We believe that as long as the the “textbook” racism of July 6 lives on in the Republican party, July 6 is a day that must be remembered and have attention brought to it.

Vanilla is pretty much the most respected of spices. And there is no better Vanilla than the Vanilla produced by the people of Mexico. So for eight years now we’ve been having an outrageously good deal on Mexican Vanilla extract to mark this day.

And of course the problem with Trump launching his Republican primary campaign with “textbook” racism is that it worked. He’s not actually dumb. He’s a con man. He knows there are those things people tell themselves and there are those things people actually believe, and that it’s in the difference between that someone like him does their thing.

The other Republican candidates believed that Republican voters were split into camps. There were the fiscal conservatives who were there to balance the budget. There where the small government crowd who had weird bathtub fantasies dreaming of shrinking government to a size where it could be drowned. Then there were the Republican religious types who somehow imagined Jesus to be really into guns and border patrol cosplay.

Trump's opponents believed the path to victory was winning one of those groups outright and just enough from the other two groups to deny victory to their rivals. Trump on the other hand understood that in reality, virtually nobody was backing the Republican party for balanced budgets, small government, or the Ten Commandments. Those were just the socially acceptable excuses they gave. Truth was they were there for the racism.

So July 6 Trump went all racist and just like that all three groups lined up behind him and elected him president. In his first term he ran up trillion dollar deficits in times of prosperity; grew the federal government to its largest size ever; and, we learned with his Trump University, he literally lied to people to steal their money, which he then used to buy the silence of women he was having adulterous relations with.

How did Republican voters respond to learning he was the exact 180 degree opposite of the reasons they claim they voted Republican? By electing him the Republican candidate for president ever since.

For the most part no one wins elections by talking about why those they seek to defeat do what they do or how they go about doing it. Elections are won by presenting something people want more. Elections are won by having fun.

Still, until the Republicans seek to honestly address the racism that so weaves its way through everything they do, this needs to be brought up. Historically, July 6 is a good day to do it.

Ten out of ten racists agree that, given the choice between the Republican party and the Democratic party, racists prefer Republicans.

Does voting for the party that is preferred by racists and that intentionally goes out of its way to court and encourage racist voters make every Republican voter a racist? Yes, absolutely, of course it does :)

With Monday’s Outrageous “Supreme” Court decision and all six Republican justices now saying Trump is our King, in addition to a $16.59 Mexican Vanilla Extract for $5 we are offering a free $5.95 jar of our Outrage of Love Seasoning with any $5 purchase. And yes, the $5 you spend on the vanilla covers your minimum for the Outrage.

Because I too have felt the electricity and energy of the Harris-Walz campaign.

But the Electoral College is stacked against them, and the race is nail-bitingly close. That’s why we must focus on turning out as many key voters as possible in this final election sprint.

I have little faith in the Electoral College because it gives a profoundly unfair benefit to the Republican Party. ABC News's election resource, FiveThirtyEight, found that in 2020, Republicans had the largest Electoral College advantage in seventy years!

Despite Trump’s Electoral College advantage, I have hope. My good friends at MoveOn are working around the clock to get out the vote in critical battleground states. MoveOn has an incredible track record of turning out the precise voters who will make the difference in this election: people with progressive values who do not consistently vote. MoveOn's special sauce is engaging these voters on the issues they care about and getting them to the polls.

The only way for us to win this election is to turn out these voters.

We can and we must do more to turn out inconsistent voters in battleground states in these crucial final days. Will you make a monthly donation to help make sure MoveOn has the resources to power their critical get-out-the-vote program, secure a decisive win for Kamala Harris, and then organize MoveOn members to defend the will of the people and protect free and fair elections?

871,"The general election—and the future of our nation—will likely be decided by a tiny number of votes in a very, very small handful of battleground states.

How tiny a number of votes? Well, on average, Biden won by only FIVE ✋votes per precinct in the critical states of Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin in the 2020 presidential election. Without those crucial votes—a miniscule 0.00026% of all votes cast in the election—Trump would still be president.

And in this year’s election, polling in battleground districts shows projections within the margin of error, making the outcome hard to predict. That’s why it’s even more critical that we spread the word and contact voters about showing up to the polls.
Voter targeting matters. And getting these voters to the polls is MoveOn’s secret sauce.

In 2020, MoveOn’s innovative get-out-the-vote program resulted in 50,000 unlikely voters casting a ballot in battleground districts. To replicate our success and defeat dangerous MAGA candidates this year, we’re executing a state-of-the-art, evidence-based campaign to identify and turn out the critical voters we'll need to win in November.

MoveOn has an in-house analytics team of top data scientists with advanced degrees in the field. Between them, our team has dozens of years of technical experience building sophisticated predictive models.

Our team of data scientists built a model to identify the precise voters we'll need to turn out to win. And then they worked to figure out the right messages to communicate with these voters.

Our methods are proven and effective. But with Election Day fast approaching, we need your support to reach as many of these key voters as possible. Can you make a donation now to power MoveOn’s work to turn out the voters who can tip the victory to us this November and stop Trump, MAGA, and Project 2025 from taking over our democracy?

He's never wiped down a table in his life.

He's never had to fix his own car.

He's never struggled to make ends meet.

He does not know what it means to check your paycheck every week to see what you've got left.

So when Trump attacks Alexandria as 'just a young girl,' we know what really scares him: She comes from a low-income background and is one of just a few working-class people elected to Congress. That makes a lot of classist, ageist, misogynist, and racist people — such as Donald Trump — mad.

They're terrified because AOC has built something they can't control: a movement powered by people, not corporate money. A movement proving you don't need a golden escalator or a McDonald's costume to understand policy and fight for change.

When Trump dismisses her as 'an average student at best,' he's not just attacking AOC. He's attacking every working person who dares to lead. Every young person who dreams big. Every woman who speaks truth to power.

But here's what Trump doesn't understand: Each dismissive comment just proves how much they fear what this movement is building. Because while they're busy underestimating AOC, we're building transformative change — from Medicare for All to democratizing fundraising power in politics.

AOC doesn't have corporate PACs or billionaire donors. The average donation to her campaign is just $19 - from people who know what it means to check their paycheck every week. That's what scares them most – that we can build real power, together, without owing anything to the big money interests.

Chip in $19 today to show Trump what really scares him – grassroots power that can't be bought or bullied.

949,"We can help! $2 Tasty Burger Blends! Republican promises made. Republican promises not kept. I wish I could show you my shocked face.

Next week Milwaukee hosts the Republican “Nothing Burger” Convention. Seems just like with the four years of the Trump administration, the four days of the Republican Convention have left everyone in the restaurant industry here in Milwaukee unemployed and hurting for cash.

The Republicans promised big bookings if Milwaukee took on the costs of their convention and left restaurants available for the week of the convention. Never happened. Instead it’s just a week of empty promises leaving empty restaurants.

In a recent Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article one restaurant owner called it all a “Nothing Burger.” For a decade now all the Republicans have done is over promised and under delivered. I’m not sure why we still get fooled by this.

But we here at Penzeys are very much at the ready to turn Nothing Burgers into very tasty Something Burgers! Visit for regularly $3.95 Penzeys Seasoned Salt, $5.95 BBQ 3,000, $5.59 Arizona Dreaming, and $6.29 Chicago Steak Seasoning all for just $2 each.

But ultimately it’s Your Burger, Your Choice. So your choice of a free-with-$5-spending of an up-to-$7.95 value quarter-cup jar for burgers or for whatever is best for you at this time in your life. Just spend $5 and be ready to show this post.

Online at , once you have $5 in additional spending, enter 1973 into the apply code box at checkout and your highest-priced quarter-cup jar up to $7.95 in value will automatically become free. It’s easy.

And if you are coming to Milwaukee next week to be a part of protesting or just to take it all in, please find a restaurant downtown, or anywhere in the greater Milwaukee area, and have a meal. If you could tip like you had 2-3 meals it would help a lot. It’s the staff that is paying the true costs of this convention.

Everything with Republicans these days is just so unfair. Thanks for caring about what’s fair.

And if you are downtown, please stop by our Penzeys store on the southeast corner of Water and Wisconsin right across from the security zone. It will no doubt be fun and memorable. Every day during the convention we will have new offers and new posts.

$6.29 Chicago Steak for just $2 is a heck of a deal. But don’t miss the $3.95 Penzeys Seasoned Salt for that same $2. Whatever you make burgers from, our Seasoned Salt truly is awesome. Buy extras and share please.

And yes, Your Burger, Your Choice, and 1973. The Republicans have already turned back the clock on Women’s Rights fifty years. How much further do we let them go?

If you hand-make a protest sign for next week, please take a picture and send it to us at editor@penzeys.com and we will do what we can to amplify your voice.

Thanks for everything you are!

For example, we know that young voters get most of their news online, so our team is running highly targeted digital ads to reach voters through apps, websites, and social media.

“This [plan] is the fastest way to erode US leadership and to reduce the living standard of Americans,” said Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a professor emeritus of economics at Syracuse University.

According to a new report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, the 80% of Americans who earn under $157,500 per year would pay an average of $2,872 more annually as a result of Trump’s tariffs – on products ranging from food, liquor, and coffee to clothing to consumer electronics like computers and smartphones.

Republicans! Our Democracy’s greatest foe ever!

We tried. We were ready to take a new path. But then Republicans just used the opening to become an even greater risk to the survival of our democracy.

In the wake of Saturday’s events, Speaker of the House Johnson wants President Biden to stop talking about what Republicans did January 6. He wants the president to go silent on how dangerous they’ve become to everything that is America. Don’t do it, Joe!

And ask any old honest conservative if you can still find one. They will tell you the very first step to having people stop saying you are a threat to democracy is to stop being a threat to democracy.

But in this moment of coming together, in this moment of calming it all down, the Republicans and their Trump-appointed judge obstruct Justice and just throw out a seriously well evidenced espionage case against the former president.

Milwaukee Mardi Gras!
To celebrate Convention Tuesday here in Milwaukee, 30% off our best Mardi Gras Spices and Seasonings!

Milwaukee is a really good spot for conventions. Great people, great prices, great food. We love our conventions and all who attend. But if we are to be honest here, this one is really different from all the others. This one is, how shall I put this… Just really Greazy.

Love the sinner and all, but man there has never been a convention here in Milwaukee where everybody is all on the take like this one. From the fossil fuel lobbyists trying to squeeze out a few billion more in profit$ while doing trillions of dollars of damage to our environment all the way down to the first-time delegate on sale for a free breakfast buffet and a picture with their “heroes.”

We love them all, but there’s no way around it, it’s Fat Tuesday here in Milwaukee. Luckily we have good seasonings for that. And through Wednesday they are 30% off. You can check out the whole list here:

But a few of my favorites are the classic Cajun Seasoning, Vanilla Sugar for donuts and deep fried treats, and Ozark fried chicken seasoning. And don’t miss our Florida Seasoned Pepper; not only is it really good, it’s got a touch of citrus to it that kind of cuts the greasiness. Plus it’s salt-free so you can enjoy your deep-fried foods the healthy way : )

Also two free $3.95 Justice Seasonings with any purchase if you use the code SHARE in the apply code box at checkout at or show this post on your phone in our stores:

Republicans won’t work for justice. As we saw today they only work to obstruct it. So it’s up to us to share it. Justice Seasoning is awesome. But don’t take my word for it, check out the comments below. People really like it.

And free shipping with $40 spending, but we’ve dropped the charge for orders under $40 to just $4.95 to make it easy for first-time customers to give us a try.

What we do works because our customers support us doing it. If you like what we are doing, now is the time to let us know.

Thanks!

Happy Milwaukee Mardi Gras!
Let the Sausage Roll!

Because I too have felt the electricity and energy of the Harris-Walz campaign.

But if the election were tomorrow, the most likely outcome would be Vice President Kamala Harris narrowly winning the popular vote but Donald Trump winning the Electoral College.

We’ve been here before—Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency because of the Electoral College and the Supreme Court. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by millions but lost the Electoral College, and thus the presidency.

It's because of the Electoral College that one of the nation's top election forecasters, Nate Silver, gives Trump a 64.4% chance of winning the presidency. According to his highly respected, nonpartisan model, Vice President Harris has only a 35.3% chance of victory.

This is a gruesome prediction, but I have hope. My good friends at MoveOn are working around the clock to get out the vote in critical battleground states. MoveOn has an incredible track record of turning out the precise voters who will make the difference in this election: people with progressive values who do not consistently vote. MoveOn's special sauce is engaging these voters on the issues they care about and getting them to the polls.

The only way for us to win this election is to turn out these voters—including young people and those in marginalized communities—people who face HUGE obstacles to voting, in part due to MAGA voter suppression laws and the Supreme Court’s decimation of the Voting Rights Act.

We can and we must do more to turn out inconsistent voters in battleground states—starting right now. Will you make a monthly donation to help MoveOn power their critical get-out-the-vote program, combat voter suppression, and secure a decisive win for Kamala Harris?

1034,"Hi! It’s Robert Reich here, and unfortunately, I’ve got some bad news: One of the nation's top election forecasters, Nate Silver, is giving Donald Trump a 64.4% chance of winning the presidency.

Despite the energy and hope that the Harris-Walz campaign has brought to the table, if the election were tomorrow, the most likely outcome would be Vice President Harris narrowly winning the popular vote and Trump winning the Electoral College.

We’ve been here before—Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency because of the Electoral College and the Supreme Court. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by millions but lost the Electoral College, and thus the presidency.

That's why I'm asking today if you can donate whatever you can afford to help my good friends at MoveOn get out the vote in critical battleground states. MoveOn has an incredible track record of turning out the precise voters who will make the difference in this election: people with progressive values who do not consistently vote. MoveOn's special sauce is engaging these voters on the issues they care about and getting them to the polls.

And how do they do it? MoveOn has pioneered a voter turnout method that’s proven to be as much as FIVE times more effective than other methods. It’s called ""vote tripling,"" and it’s based on relational organizing—the principle that people are more likely to listen to their friends and social networks than anonymous ads and outreach. MoveOn’s tried and tested methods to get voters to the polls are what bring me hope.

We can and we must do more to turn out inconsistent voters in battleground states—starting right now. Will you make a monthly donation to help MoveOn power their critical get-out-the-vote program, stop MAGA, and secure a decisive win for Kamala Harris?

Cryptocurrency firm Coinbase is the top organizational donor in the 2024 election, donating more than $91 MILLION to political causes just this year, including many pro-crypto Super PACs. When companies like Coinbase donate to political causes, it’s not philanthropy—they expect a return on their investment. And that’s exactly what they’d be getting with Donald Trump, who has touted himself as “the Crypto president.”

Since 2020, the number of crypto lobbyists registered in Washington has quadrupled 💥, and the industry is spending at record levels 📈in this election. Why? Because we’re in a defining moment that will set the standard for crypto’s regulations for the next four years and beyond.

Similar to the fossil fuel and gun industries, investments by crypto firms are meant to convince politicians to have lax rules and pad their bottom line instead of protecting the interests of the people and planet. That’s one reason why MoveOn is going all in to turn out key voters in battleground districts to defeat “Crypto President” Trump and protect our democracy ✊.

Here at MoveOn, we’re the nation's largest independent progressive political organization, staffed by foremost experts on using cutting-edge digital technology to increase voter turnout. But as a grassroots organization, we can make this critical work happen only with your support.

I’m taking our fundraising seriously because — and I want to be clear — we need to take this race very seriously.

We can’t underestimate the amount of support my opponent can receive from national Republicans and special interests.

We can’t underestimate the threat of Republicans controlling the Senate, passing a national abortion ban, and other extremist items that have been on Donald Trump’s agenda.

And we can’t underestimate what would happen if our progressive movement for big, structural change loses its momentum.

The amount that we raise right now will determine how strong we can compete — and how much we can invest in campaigning for our plans and growing popularity and support for them. So if you’re able, will you chip in any amount so we can demonstrate our movement’s strength?",[0]

1104,"Mayor Rapp, without deliberation with Vienna City Council, took it upon himself to formally request the Wood County Board of Education donate Vienna School to the City of Vienna. Originally, the BOE requested city property at the ballfields at Jackson Park (located off Rosemar road) for the location of the new consolidated elementary school. In exchange for the eleven acres of recreational property, the BOE would give the City both Vienna School and Maplewood School in a land swap.

The original plan fell through once it was determined that the land at Jackson Park was not suitable for building the new school. The new consolidated elementary school may be built at the former OVU Campus which is currently being renovated by the WVUP Foundation for the new Innovation and Technology Center.

I have financial concerns about accepting Vienna School. Does Vienna have the money to renovate the school and bring it up to current standards? Mayor Rapp has never provided a financial plan to go with his desire to accept the school. It is important for any decision regarding public assets to be backed by a comprehensive plan and clear communication with the community.

The council is aware of considerable issues at Vienna School such as asbestos, necessary window replacement, lack of air conditioning, and failure to meet ADA compliance. But Mayor Rapp has never provided a complete facility condition report for Council’s review.

While the City of Vienna has $10,000,000 in Capital Reserves, the city also has a laundry list of unfinished projects that will need to be completed in the next term. Grant money may be available for some of the renovation and remediation of Vienna School, but that will only be a portion of the necessary funding for such a large undertaking.

Based on past performance, Mayor Rapp’s method is to move forward with a project without an honest assessment of costs or a plan for how the City will pay for it.

Where is the plan to develop the former Johns Manville industrial site? Where is the kayak launch promised during the last election cycle? How will Vienna pay for the development of Spencer’s Landing? Vienna’s infrastructure needs significant and costly investment. The list continues.

Once Vienna Elementary School is no longer in use the property could become an issue, especially for the residents in that neighborhood. Vienna needs to insure there is a positive outcome for when the school is no longer in operation.

If I am elected as your next Mayor, I promise to work with the next City Council and the community to find the right solution for Vienna School. In the end, the City may decide to take possession of the old school, but we need to have an honest conversation about costs first before moving forward.

Vienna does not have endless resources. We must manage our spending responsibly and not fly by the seat of our pants every time a new opportunity presents itself. My record as your Vienna City Councilwoman and a Director on the Vienna Utility Board demonstrates my commitment to fiscal responsibility.

I am also committed to working with whomever the voters elect to serve on the next Council. Unlike Mayor Rapp, I am NOT a part of any slate that would concentrate unchecked power. Vienna faces the real possibility that two families will control our future. Only the voters can stop nepotism so please consider your ballot carefully when voting for municipal offices.",[0]
1105,"Do you remember? On the very first day of Donald Trump’s presidency, MILLIONS of Women’s Marchers took to the streets to tell him and his malevolent band of misogynist misfits:

We will outlast you.
We will defeat you.
We will never back down.

We’re renewing our commitment to this fight. When Donald goes back to the White House this January, we’ll be ready for him. We’re expecting MILLIONS of Women’s Marchers to join us in Washington and across the country on January 18th, 2025!

Pulling off a march this big is expensive, and early donations make all the difference. That’s why we need your help now more than ever so we can capture America’s attention and plan a march so big that our message cannot be ignored.

1107,"In just a moment, we are going to ask you to make a well-timed donation to Team Harris-Walz.

But first, you deserve to know why this request -- especially today -- is so important.

Our team has received a record number of individual, small-dollar donations. Vice President Harris is very proud of that fact. You should be, too.

But according to campaign finance records -- when you factor in super PAC spending -- we are being outspent by the Trump campaign and their extremist allies in some pretty critical swing states.

It goes without saying that if we lose these states, we lose the election.

The good news is, the margins are close enough that with a surge of individual donations to Team Harris-Walz, we can catch up.

But that is going to take people who care enough about the outcome to make today the day they donate.",[0]

It is urgent to act NOW, before Donald Trump takes office, as he has shown major disregard for wildlife in the past. And Trump will be even more organized, extreme and vindictive this time.
